1
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,800
The Headlines:

2
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,240
Authorities have devised a solution

3
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,800
to prevent future MRT breakdowns.

4
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,280
Slash, slash, slash.

5
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,960
Singapore’s retrenchment rate
has hit a seven-year high.

6
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,800
And one policeman
speaks out against the trend

7
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,400
of handsome police spokespersons.

8
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,280
Hello and welcome to The Noose.

9
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,520
I’m B.B.See.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,440
And I’m Xin Hua Hua.

11
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,960
Hey ladies,

12
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,680
if kissing is the language of love,

13
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,040
how about we start a conversation?

14
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,600
Aren’t there already enough languages
for people to reject you?

15
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,560
Now, on to our first story for tonight.

16
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,600
Government authorities have finally
come up with a solution

17
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,240
for the frequent MRT breakdowns...

18
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,800
no, really.

19
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,800
Here’s Bertha Haryani with the report.

20
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,800
The Singapore Trains Department (STD)

21
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,840
has had it with
the constant breakdowns

22
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,920
and its own general inability

23
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,240
to deliver on its most basic service

24
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,040
of getting people
from one place to another

25
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,040
without track faults, train faults,
and signaling interruptions.

26
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,520
Here’s one of the executives
at STD to tell us more.

27
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,200
I am the Chief Transmitter of STD

28
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,160
and also a member of the board.

29
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,560
After an extensive review

30
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,360
of our signaling infrastructure
and aging trains,

31
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,120
we have concluded that
the fault actually lies with…

32
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,440
wait for it…

33
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,400
overuse of the train system.

34
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,040
The network simply isn’t designed

35
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,000
to handle such high ridership.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,560
So the board has concluded that

37
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,200
if ridership goes down,

38
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,960
so will the strain on the network,

39
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,200
and hence the frequency
of breakdowns.

40
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,160
The Government Transport
Authority (GTA)

41
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,600
has been working with the STD
to come up with a solution.

42
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,880
And it appears that the solution

43
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,360
is to discourage commuters

44
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,280
from using the train system
in the first place.

45
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,480
As part of an initiative
to discourage commuters

46
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,320
from using the train system,

47
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:55,200
the board of STD has decided
to raise fares by 500 percent.

48
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,480
A single trip from Ang Mo Kio
to Raffles Place,

49
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,600
which used to cost $1.43,

50
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,840
will now cost $7.15.

51
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,400
Well, all this train breakdowns have really
wasted too much of people’s time,

52
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,800
and time is money.

53
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,200
So from our point of view,

54
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,400
we believe that
raising the fares for the train,

55
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,920
we are actually going to make it
more affordable in the long run.

56
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,520
Now let me qualify my statement.

57
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,800
As we all know the ERP
system very well

58
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,760
and it is also a very good system,

59
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,880
the increase of the train
fares will result in lesser commuters

60
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,600
and therefore lesser breakdowns.

61
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,720
Now in addition, we are also hoping
that this movement

62
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,080
will give the sandwich class a push,

63
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,760
in buying the car that
they have always wanted.

64
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,080
Now that is an absolutely,
great thing, isn't it?

65
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,800
Oh, you don’t know the sandwich class?

66
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,880
They are the kind of people that
will spend $22 on a sandwich.

67
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,200
While the government recognises
that this move

68
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,920
will likely increase
the number of cars on the roads

69
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,760
due to a mad rush by those
in the sandwich class to buy cars,

70
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,040
it maintains that this is the best way

71
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,680
to solve the problem of
frequent breakdowns.

72
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,360
Actually, now that the train fare
is so expensive,

73
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,440
taking the train is very comfortable,

74
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,920
very fast and very efficient.

75
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,400
Just the other day,
I went to the train station

76
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,960
to buy an EZ link card

77
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,640
to try and take the train.

78
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,040
There was no queue,

79
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,000
and in the train, it was very empty.

80
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,440
There was nobody.

81
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,800
With so few riders

82
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,000
and running under capacity,

83
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,560
how to break down?

84
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,920
I used to take the train
to work every day.

85
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,680
But now that it’s almost
as expensive as taking a taxi,

86
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,720
which is almost as expensive
as buying a car,

87
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,320
I might as well buy a car, right?

88
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,720
I mean...

89
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,760
what’s another loan, right?

90
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,040
Home loan,

91
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,160
renovation loan,

92
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,640
personal loan, car loan.

93
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,680
Don’t even know whether
I can finish paying, or not.

94
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,760
I spend way too much on sandwiches.

95
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,080
Which is delicious,

96
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,240
which is fabulicious,

97
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,080
and stylolicious. Do you want?

98
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,760
I tell you, the tuna
comes from cold countries.

99
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,240
You try, ah! Try!

100
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,320
Try, ah.

101
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,760
The government has warned

102
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,600
that COE prices in the
upcoming months will likely increase

103
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,920
due to a higher demand for cars
from the sandwich class.

104
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,280
What’s new, I suppose?

105
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,240
This is Bertha Haryani,

106
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,080
reporting for The Noose.

107
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,800
Good thing I negotiated
for transportation

108
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,280
to be covered in my expat package.

109
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,440
Wait! What?

110
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,320
You got an expat package?

111
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,200
Yes.

112
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,160
We need to talk about this.

113
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,120
On to our next story.

114
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,280
Good-looking spokespeople, like me,

115
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,200
attract the public’s attention.

116
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,800
But as Jacques Ooi finds out,

117
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,080
this strategy has its own pitfalls.

118
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,440
Throughout the ages,

119
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,760
uniformed personnel have always
been considered irresistible,

120
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,360
with their toned bodies,

121
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,200
well-pressed number 1s

122
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,560
and immaculately-groomed faces.

123
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,720
Even emotionless Singaporeans

124
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,080
are not immune to the charms
of handsome policemen,

125
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,080
as evidenced by the popularity of the...

126
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,080
“Shop theft is a crime”
cardboard policeman,

127
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,760
and the rather youthful auxiliary
police officer,

128
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,000
who checks our passports
at Changi Airport.

129
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,480
While Singaporeans are happy

130
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,480
to ogle at these men in blue,

131
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,560
one prominent policeman

132
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,720
is rather worried by this trend

133
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,360
of good-looking spokespeople.

134
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,960
By only focusing on handsome officers,

135
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,120
you are providing the public

136
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,360
with an unrealistic
expectation of policemen.

137
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,920
Just yesterday, I responded to
a noise-disturbance call

138
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,320
that involved a few youngsters
who were creating a ruckus.

139
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,480
And the girl who answered
the door said,

140
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,520
“Hey, Uncle, don’t bluff.

141
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,120
You cannot be policeman."

142
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,600
"Nowadays,” she said,

143
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,480
“all policemen look like Elvin Ng.”

144
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,280
How are we supposed to
do our jobs like that?

145
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,960
Apart from speaking up on the issue,

146
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,800
Sergeant Dollah
has also challenged the YANDAO,

147
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,520
or Young And Attractive Officers union,

148
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,960
to compete against him

149
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,680
in a one-on-one race

150
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,680
during the annual intra-police games.

151
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,440
This is my way of proving that anything
the YANDAO can do,

152
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,600
we can do also.

153
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,760
You know, my dream is...

154
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,720
for the next SFP,
Singapore Frontline Police,

155
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,480
the spokesperson,

156
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,080
he has to have...

157
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,640
a "dad bod".

158
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,640
Did you know that people with
"dad bods" live longer?

159
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,600
This is the body of a man

160
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,680
who tirelessly provides for his family

161
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,280
and caringly eats his childrens’ leftovers

162
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,880
when they complain that
his cooking sucks.

163
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,880
-Yes...
-Come, let's go.

164
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,240
Oh, start already?

165
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,600
Sorry, excuse me,
I have a score to settle.

166
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,760
While netizens have voiced their
support for Sergeant Dollah’s cause,

167
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,480
the SFP is unlikely to change their
handsome-spokesperson tactic.

168
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,400
If you check the
hashtag #shoptheftisacrime,

169
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,040
you will notice that on Instagram,

170
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,920
November last year,
we had 118 posts.

171
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,880
That is 44 more posts than #DFTRch5.

172
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,880
But actually, what is "DFTR"?

173
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,920
But all is not lost for Sergeant Dollah.

174
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,280
The Police Commissioner
will be issuing a statement,

175
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,200
and commending him for his drive
on the intranet,

176
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,000
as well as rewarding him with

177
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,960
$20 worth of supermarket vouchers.

178
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,680
Yay.

179
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,480
This is Jacques Ooi,
reporting for The Noose.

180
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,120
$20 can buy you
a ten-kilogram bag of rice.

181
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,840
Well, just make sure it’s not plastic.

182
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,440
Okay, no problem.

183
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,400
We’re going for a commercial break,

184
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,520
where you’ll mainly see trailers
of the other shows on this channel.

185
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,440
If you don’t want to see those,

186
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,560
head to toggle.sg/thenoose

187
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,240
to catch up on any past episodes
you might have missed.

188
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,720
We’ll be right back.

189
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,560
Welcome back to The Noose.

190
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,160
Globally, 2016 was a bad year.

191
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,160
For Singapore, it was no better,

192
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,080
as 2016 marked a seven-year high

193
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,600
for the number of workers laid off.

194
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,960
Here’s Jojo Joget with the story.

195
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,280
37-year-old IT manager, Roland Seow,

196
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,560
had planned to quit his job
in December.

197
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,520
But one morning in October,

198
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,560
as he stepped into his office,

199
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,840
Seow was asked to go
to a senior manager’s office

200
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,120
for an urgent meeting.

201
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,440
It was there that he learnt

202
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,480
that he was being retrenched.

203
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,520
<i>Huat ah!</i>

204
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,440
If I had resigned in December,

205
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,400
I would not have qualified
for my year-end bonus.

206
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,200
But because they decided to sack me,

207
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,760
now they have to pay me
eight months severance pay,

208
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,720
one month pay for each year
I served in the company.

209
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,440
So after I clear off all my
credit-card debt,

210
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,800
I finally, can have a staycation,

211
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,360
at Hotel 81.

212
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,640
<i>Huat ah!</i>

213
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,800
According to numbers released
by the government,

214
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,960
the number of layoffs hit
a seven-year high

215
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,880
in the first nine months of 2016 alone.

216
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,000
With economic prospects
looking bleak on the horizon,

217
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,880
more people are expected

218
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,280
to be retrenched in the coming months.

219
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,960
Die!

220
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,280
Sore throat ah, sore throat.

221
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,400
Do you have honey?

222
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,200
Honey plus Tongkat Ali.

223
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,120
Can, ah.

224
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,120
I sound like a frog.

225
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,080
Actually, the Singapore
economy is in deep...

226
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,160
trouble, I tell you.

227
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,920
You know how I know?

228
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,280
Because my esteemed colleagues
told me so.

229
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,320
The problem with Singaporeans

230
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,160
is that they know how
to get from 0 to 80.

231
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,240
But they have no idea
how to get from 80 to 100.

232
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,720
And that is where
you earn your money.

233
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,160
Actually who wrote this
statement, ah?

234
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,840
Can explain to me what
it means, or not?

235
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,640
Still rolling?

236
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,080
I don’t know about 80 to 100...all that.

237
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,000
All I know is...

238
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,680
life is very stressful.

239
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,880
You know,

240
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,160
every time I come into the office,

241
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,960
I have to look over my shoulder
to see whether

242
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,880
my boss is coming to retrench me.

243
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,800
Last time,

244
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,880
I only had to worry whether
he was coming to harass me.

245
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,960
Human-resource experts say

246
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,080
retrenchments,
although painful for workers,

247
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,400
affects employers greatly too.

248
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,800
Whenever they talk about retrenchment,

249
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,480
they always blame it on the employers.

250
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,720
But what can we do?

251
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,680
If I don’t take this drastic action,

252
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,720
I tell you, my business
will bungkus (pack).

253
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,560
I think the last few months
already bungkus (pack).

254
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,560
Not like the nasi lemak,
which is very nice,

255
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,360
but this bungkus (pack) is very horrible.

256
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,560
Just two days ago,

257
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,240
I retrenched another 25 of my workers,

258
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,800
so 25 plus…

259
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,600
I know it feels a bit lonely,

260
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,520
but on the bright side,

261
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:59,000
I get to save cost on this corner,

262
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,880
where the recreation room was.

263
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,680
Last time, a lot of workers

264
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,320
used to spend their time
at the foosball table,

265
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,080
pool table, don't know what...
PS games...

266
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,600
All kinds of money wasted.

267
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,560
At least now, I don’t have to
spend on that anymore,

268
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,120
and even though I

269
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,720
still hold the title
as MD of this company,

270
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,520
but I get to re-learn new skills,

271
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,200
as a receptionist,

272
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,880
as a delivery boy.

273
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,760
Now I understand the job better,

274
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,840
and of course, at times,
as the tea lady and cleaner.

275
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,840
Excuse me.

276
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,320
Hello, yes?

277
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,000
Yeah, give me ten minutes
and we will deliver the thing to you.

278
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,160
Thank you.

279
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,800
Food delivery. Excuse me.

280
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,920
Hello? Yeah?

281
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,520
Okay, okay.

282
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,080
12 o’clock, I will give you the invoice.
Thank you.

283
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Do you want tea?
Later, I will make for you tea,

284
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,200
but as you see,

285
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,760
spare a thought for people like me.

286
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,480
Hello, yeah?

287
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,760
No, mak, no, no no.
You cannot come to the office.

288
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,000
You stay at home, mak.

289
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,920
I will send the food to you.

290
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,760
Singaporeans are too pampered.

291
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,080
They rely too much on other people
to solve their problems.

292
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,640
Why? Because labour is cheap,

293
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,920
so they no need to pick up
some basic skills.

294
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,640
You see, all these young people,

295
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,600
open stylo-mylo café, hipster café,

296
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,600
but they don’t even know
how to change a light bulb.

297
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,480
They don’t even know
how to turn on the oven

298
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,840
or know what will cause
the power to trip.

299
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,760
Because it’s so much easier
to pick up the phone

300
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,320
and call someone else to help.
Correct or cowrong?

301
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,960
I agree.

302
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,800
Young people, these days,
always want to look cool only.

303
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,560
Like a wise man once said,

304
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,360
"Tom Cruise always look funny…"

305
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,080
What?

306
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,520
Oh, not Tom Cruise.

307
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,560
What is it?

308
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,840
"Torn clothes always look funny,

309
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,360
until your dad gets fired."

310
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,040
Reporting for The Noose,

311
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,040
this is Jojo Joget.

312
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,280
Eh, I still don’t get it.

313
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,480
Going for a quick pee break.

314
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,800
Be back in two minutes.

315
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,240
Thanks for staying with
us on The Noose!

316
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,920
Amongst one of the more
popular items to be put in a bun,

317
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,240
hot dogs are a tasty
and enjoyable treat for many.

318
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,280
But recently, serious debate
has sprung up

319
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,240
over the use of condiments
for this delicious snack.

320
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,560
Andre Chichak has the story.

321
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,440
Long, curvy and meaty.

322
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,600
The humble hot dog is easy-to-make

323
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,440
and provides a tasty package
of carbohydrates and proteins.

324
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,600
But recently, heated on-line debate
has sprung up

325
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,320
about the proper way to
savour a sausage,

326
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,160
with some resorting to outright
saucy remarks.

327
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,440
Recently, discussions on
on-line hot-dog-enthusiast group,

328
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,240
Do Not Cross The Yellow Line,
got really heated

329
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,040
when a local café
started offering ketchup

330
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,120
as a condiment option for hot dogs.

331
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,480
It is understood that members of
Do Not Cross The Yellow Line

332
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,480
have strong beliefs about mustard

333
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,960
being the only sauce used
to dress hot dogs,

334
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,120
and do not condone the use of ketchup.

335
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:40,680
According to the National Hot Dog
and Sausage Council of the United States,

336
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,320
ketchup is not an advisable
condiment for hot dogs.

337
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,280
You see, we prefer the
time-honoured traditions of using

338
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,840
mustard, relish,

339
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,200
cheese, chilli,

340
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,080
onions for hot dogs.

341
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,680
We are simply trying to ensure
that this meat dish,

342
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,200
that we know and love,

343
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,720
is best appreciated as it was
originally created. Right?

344
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,080
And hence our group name,
which pays tribute to mustard,

345
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,520
not the other thing:

346
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,160
"The Yellow Line".

347
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,920
And it also pays tribute

348
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,640
to our firm belief

349
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,200
that you do not want to cross us,

350
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,160
because if you cross us…

351
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,880
Yes, while the text does say so,

352
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,320
despite the statement from the National
Hot Dog and Sausage Council,

353
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:28,560
a survey by the Council
shows that 79 percent of Americans

354
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,560
regard ketchup as
an acceptable topping,

355
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,680
and the widespread support
comes, especially,

356
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,840
from Americans between
18-34 years old.

357
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,720
We are not talking about Americans
and their hot dogs;

358
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,160
we are talking about hot dogs
being served in a Singapore-ese café.

359
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,520
I think we should actually look at
global food trends here.

360
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,000
The Chile ones, they eat it creamy

361
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,760
with avocado and mayonnaise...

362
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,960
Hey, hey, no foreign
intervention, please...

363
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,760
-Excuse me, can we please, calm down.
-No foreign intervention!

364
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,120
We don’t want to be too
thin-skinned here.

365
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,160
Okay, fine. Okay, fine.

366
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,960
All I'm saying is that
we should be able to choose

367
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,600
how we want to put meat in our mouths,

368
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,480
without the unnecessary
overreach of civil groups

369
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,400
and all the unnecessary mockery
on social networking sites.

370
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,120
Yes, I understand the distaste

371
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,920
for the taste of tomato and meat,

372
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,000
but honestly, in the privacy
of our homes,

373
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,480
some of us are not above
enjoying some beans with franks

374
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,440
or even some sliced sausage

375
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,600
with baked beans in tomato sauce.

376
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,920
What are you accusing me of?

377
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,840
Are you saying that I cook my hot dogs
on an open flame?

378
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,080
Is that what you are saying?

379
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,200
What the...

380
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,440
And so the debate rages on and
has stirred the pot,

381
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,000
with many Singaporeans chiming in
on flavourial freedom

382
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,120
and that a mandate should
be sought from a legal perspective.

383
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,240
And this seems indicative of
an evolution on both culinary culture

384
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,680
and online behaviour...

385
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,200
Lap cheong for sale!

386
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,040
Taiwan Sausage for sale!

387
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,080
Oh great!

388
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,760
Looks like another fight and
sausage-fest is coming!

389
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,440
This is Andre Chichak, The Noose.

390
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,560
To stay relevant in today’s
ever-changing media landscape,

The Noose is constantly
on the lookout for new talent.

392
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,120
So please, welcome our brand new
Japanese correspondent,

393

Nabuyuki “Harry” Katashi!

<i>Watashi wa Nabuyuki Katashi desu.</i>

396
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,880
But since you are all my friends,

397
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,200
you can call me Harry!

398
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:48,320
Reporting all the way
from Tokyo, Japan,

399
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,480
I am so excited to be one of the
new foreign correspondents

400
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,640
for The Noose!

401
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,080
A few weeks ago, I saw news report

402
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,720
that Singapore now has

403
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,480
its very own vending-machine café,

404
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,400
with machines selling hot food.

405
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,720
<i>Ichiban!</i>

406
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:27,480
You are only about
twenty years behind Japan,

407
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,680
but it’s never too late to join
the civilised world.

408
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,920
But it’s so funny

409
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,080
because people were queuing

410
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,120
one hour to buy their food.

411
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,120
One hour!

412
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,120
That does not make sense.

413
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,000
If you’re eating from the machine,

414
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,680
means you have no time,

415
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,560
if you have no time,

416
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,480
then why you queue?

417
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,000
I don’t think Singaporeans get it.

418
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,000
Singaporeans not get it...

419
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,800
<i>Watashi wa Nabuyuki</i>
<i>Harry Katashi desu,</i>

420
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,440
reporting from Tokyo, Japan.

421
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,320
<i>Goran itadaki arigatou gozaimashita.</i>

422
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,840
Well we’ve come to end
of this edition of The Noose.

423
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,040
I’m B.B.See...

424
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,760
And I'm Xin Hua Hua,

425
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,720
the man of your dreams.

426
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,840
Good night.

427
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,880
Those dreams are called nightmares.

428
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,400
Not funny, that's an old joke.

429
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,760
That's true.
