00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,120
The government rolls out a new</font>
training course for maids.

4
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,760
Thai football fans are up in arms

5
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,520
over a Singapore businessman’s
ownership of their beloved club.

6
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,840
Saving money and lives.

7
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,280
More Singaporeans are choosing
to give up driving.

8
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,080
Hello and welcome to The Noose.

9
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,680
I’m B.B.See…

10
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,640
And I’m Xin Hua Hua.

11
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,040
Hey, ladies,

12
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,680
even if there wasn’t any gravity...

13
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,160
I will still fall for you.

14
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,120
On your face, I hope.

15
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,520
Topping The Noose tonight,

16
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,560
the government has rolled out
a new mandatory training course

17
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,240
for domestic helpers.

18
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,360
That’s right.

19
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,080
The Noose understands

20
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,280
that this course will teach maids

21
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,720
how not to overstep the boundary

22
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,240
in terms of taking over
as parents of their charges.

23
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,720
Here’s Jacques Ooi
with more on this story.

24
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,720
They clean your homes.

25
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,920
They care for your young and old,

26
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,160
and in some cases,

27
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,600
tolerate your
less-than-humane treatment.

28
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,840
With over 220,000 foreign
domestic workers, or maids,

29
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,400
working in Singapore,

30
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,520
they have become an essential
part of the Singaporean household.

31
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,520
But a recent survey has shown that

32
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,560
many Singaporean parents

33
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,920
are becoming increasingly worried
with the idea

34
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,480
that their children are being
parented by their maids.

35
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,320
I first noticed it during
dinner last week.

36
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,080
I was sending out an urgent email
at 11 p.m. to my subordinates

37
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,560
about the virtues of
work-life compromise

38
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,920
when my 2-year-old suddenly
shouted, “Mama!”

39
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,520
At first, I was going to
ask him to shut up

40
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,000
because I thought he
was disturbing me.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,320
But then when I turned around,

42
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,640
I saw that he was calling
out to my helper!

43
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,040
The best part is, my helper didn’t do
anything to correct his mistake!

44
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,760
Luckily this happened at home.

45
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,960
Imagine if it happened in front
of my relatives.

46
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,680
That would be so embarrassing.

47
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,960
Hey, there mate!

48
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,600
I’m a super chill parent.

49
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,120
And I want my kid to be
<i>muchos chillax, like me, too.

50
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,760
But the helper’s like...

51
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,880
“Sir, she hasn’t done her
homework yet, sir."

52
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,600
"Sir, the teachers are complaining, sir."

53
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,640
"Sir, she’s gonna be held
back a year, sir.”

54
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,600
Major kill buzz, dude.

55
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,240
And when I was like “whatever”,

56
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,000
she forced my kid to do her homework

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,840
till she pass her exams!

58
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,200
She was so fierce

59
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,120
till she made my little girl cry!

60
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,840
I was like, hello...

61
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,200
Who’s the parent here?

62
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,400
Who’s the parent?

63
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,720
If there is anyone who is going
to leave long-term emotional scars

64
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,080
it should be me, not her.

65
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,240
Not her!

66
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,440
Right!

67
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,600
The Ministry of Maidpower

68
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,440
has heard the complaints of
Singaporean parents

69
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,440
and are implementing a compulsory
course for all maids in Singapore.

70
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,640
This course will ensure that
foreign domestic workers

71
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,560
understand the boundaries
they are meant to keep

72
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,720
when caring for their charges.

73
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,680
Start already?

74
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,640
Actually, the solution is very simple.

75
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,680
The difference between
a parent and a maid

76
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,200
is the amount of discipline
they can dish out on the children.

77
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,200
So now, we are teaching the maids

78
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,160
to issue stern warnings,

79
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,520
but to take no concrete action
against the children’s behavior.

80
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,600
Just like the last time when my son
was ‘reprimanded’

81
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,600
for bypassing the chain
of command to whistle blow.

82
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,840
But for those with younger children

83
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,600
who find it difficult
to understand the difference,

84
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,840
we are now training the maids

85
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,840
to care for them
expressionlessly and emotionlessly.

86
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,640
And to carry them at arm’s length,

87
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,560
so that when they are finally
hugged by their parents,

88
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,000
the children will automatically
love the parent more.

89
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,600
While the course is being
rolled out in phases,

90
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,960
one maid who has gone
through the programme

91
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,080
is exceptionally happy that the
government has made it compulsory.

92
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,840
At first I felt sad,

93
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,040
my employer don’t let me
be close to the children.

94
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,840
But then, now I realise that
children take up a lot of time!

95
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,320
Now, I can finish
the housework by 9 p.m.

96
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,320
and I can sleep by 10 p.m.

97
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,640
No need to read bedtime story,

98
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,280
no need to play with dolls.

99
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,160
I can even watch drama from
my home, Myanmar, on my phone

100
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,680
and then sleep 6 hours!

101
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,600
Good life!

102
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,080
I love Singapore!

103
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,840
It’s still too early to tell,

104
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,120
but authorities are confident that this
course will decrease dependence

105
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,320
on foreign domestic workers
in the long-run,

106
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,480
and increase the bond
between parents

107
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,320
and their ankle-biters...
I mean, their children.

108
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,680
This is Jacques Ooi,

109
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,400
reporting for The Noose.

110
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,320
Oh, those poor parents,

111
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,120
having to look after their own children.

112
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,400
Moving along,

113
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,440
Singaporean tycoon, Valen Seah,

114
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,920
is facing angry calls
to relinquish ownership

115
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,120
of Thai football club Real Patpong.

116
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,640
The club has not won a game
since August last year

117
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,440
and is now in danger
of being relegated.

118
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,920
Here’s Jojo Joget with the story.

119
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,480
Football is a funny game.

120
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,720
One moment you can be a hero

121
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,800
and the next, absolute zero.

122
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,800
But that doesn’t just apply to players.

123
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,240
Managers, coaches and now,
increasingly, owners of clubs too,

124
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,280
are realising that fans
are really like lalangs

125
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,480
that sway in the wind.

126
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,240
Take the example of Singaporean
businessman, Valen Seah.

127
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,480
In February last year, he announced
that he was buying over

128
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,960
Thai football club, Real Patpong.

129
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,760
Upon hearing the news,

130
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,520
thousands of jubilant
supporters of the club

131
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,360
turned up outside the club’s
headquarters in downtown Bangkok

132
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,200
to welcome what they saw

133
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,280
as an angel coming to
the club’s rescue.

134
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,280
<i>Sawadeekup.</i>

135
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,680
We were so happy when
Valen Seah bought the club

136
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,040
because before that,
nobody cared about Real Patpong.

137
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,840
People came to Patpong
only to see ping pong,

138
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,400
see the birds and to see goldfish.

139
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,360
But nobody cared about
our football team.

140
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,880
So, when he announced that
he is buying the club,

141
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,080
Suddenly all the media attention
was on us...

142
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,440
And finally our team got money...

143
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,320
money to buy original football boots,

144
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,880
not the imitation football boots
from Patpong night market.

145
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,800
Our boots super good!

146
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,000
Patpong Patpong Real Patpong!

147
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,720
Fast forward 12 months

148
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,640
and Real Patpong find themselves

149
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,600
fighting against relegation from
Thailand’s premier league division.

150
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,720
Seah has since fired
four coaches in the past year

151
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,840
and the club hasn’t won
a game in months.

152
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,760
Those same fans who once
welcomed him with open arms,

153
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,200
now want him to sell his majority stake.

154
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,760
Valen Seah no good…

155
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,800
I don’t know why he wants
to own the club

156
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,640
when he has no interest in
improving the quality of the club.

157
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,120
I mean, how do you expect

158
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,520
Real Patpong to compete
with the best clubs in Thailand

159
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,000
when the only players you employ

160
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,880
are from the S-league?

161
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,520
They run for 10 metres

162
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,760
and then they rest for 10 minutes.

163
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,480
Valen Seah, please go home...

164
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,560
Go home.

165
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,000
Despite calls to relinquish
ownership of the club,

166
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,360
Seah remains defiant.

167
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,200
Real Patpong used to be one
of the most popular

168
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,760
and glamourous football
teams from the...

169
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,160
70s to the 90s.

170
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,040
But since then, its fortunes have faded,

171
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,920
just like how Patpong itself

172
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,520
has become a gentrified tourist trap.

173
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,480
But I have a dream.

174
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,320
I want to make...

175
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,840
Patpong great again!

176
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,160
For starters, let me introduce our new...

177
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,560
head coach.

178
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,080
<i>Sawadeekup, my name is
<i>Pornsak Sukhumvit.</i>

179
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,920
Well, Valen Seah, good luck.

180
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,080
Reporting for The Noose,

181
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,320
this is Jojo Joget.

182
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,680
What’s up with all these
billionaires buying football clubs?

183
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,400
They should be investing in
more meaningful projects,

184
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,400
like building more gentlemen’s clubs.

185
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,800
Not like you’d be allowed in.

186
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,560
We’re off for a break.

187
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,320
Coming up, more Singaporeans
are giving up driving.

188
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,560
Stay tuned.

189
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,200
Unlike you. You are
driving me up the wall!

190
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,400
Hello and welcome back to The Noose.

191
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,280
One of the quickest ways of
getting richer in Singapore

192
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,200
is to give up driving.

193
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,360
And more Singaporeans are indeed
giving up this expensive habit.

194
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,680
But as Andre Chichak finds out,

195
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,960
money is not necessarily
the primary motivation.

196
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,520
Besides housing, owning a car is
probably the second biggest expense

197
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,720
for Singaporeans who choose to drive.

198
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,560
But even with high car prices
and exorbitant charges

199
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,320
to drive on certain roads at
certain times of the day,

200
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,280
Singapore’s car population
doesn’t look like

201
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,640
it’s going to decrease anytime soon.

202
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,520
However, there is a small but
growing number of drivers

203
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,520
who are choosing to ditch their cars

204
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,960
and go back to using public transport.

205
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,400
Most cite the prohibitive costs
of owning a car.

206
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,800
But for some, like 37-year-old
financial consultant, James Teo,

207
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,240
there are other push factors towards
public transport than just costs.

208
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,440
The high cost of driving

209
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,760
is definitely a factor in my decision
to give up driving.

210
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,680
But it’s definitely not the main reason.

211
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,040
That’s actually, my wife.

212
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,240
Whenever she’s in the car with me,
I cannot take it.

213
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,960
My GPS device
I can ignore or put to mute.

214
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,400
But the human GPS sitting beside me,

215
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,920
I cannot turn off.

216
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,760
“Turn left, Turn left.

217
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,360
Eh, why you turn left?
I told you to turn right, right?

218
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,080
It’s better for my sanity that I don’t drive.

219
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,840
For many families, having a car
is a huge convenience.

220
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,800
Besides ferrying the kids to school,

221
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,680
it also comes in handy
when you have to run errands,

222
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,760
go grocery shopping or
pick someone up from the airport.

223
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,760
However, some say
it’s a double-edged sword.

224
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,120
Honestly, I really don’t mind
driving my family around.

225
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,640
But have you been to a relative’s house

226
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,920
for a function or for a wedding

227
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,000
and there are all these old people...

228
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,720
I mean, people older than me
who don’t drive?

229
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,080
Suddenly it becomes my responsibility
to drive all these people home,

230
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,520
just because I’m one
of the few there with a car.

231
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,720
Then cannot say 'no', what.

232
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,560
Cannot say 'no' what, because of
respect and all that nonsense.

233
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,680
Then who pays for my petrol?

234
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,120
Well, you could just
not attend the functions.

235
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,600
Anyway, The Noose also
understands that

236
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,600
a growing number of drivers
are also giving up driving

237
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,640
because they are very concerned
about the bad driving habits

238
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,880
of many motorists on the road.

239
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,880
Driving on our roads nowadays,
very scary.

240
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,480
Singaporean drivers cannot even
drive straight in one direction.

241
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,200
And then all these smart alec

242
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,840
want to drive against the traffic.

243
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,920
The government should ban
all these video games

244
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,280
that consider driving recklessly as a...

245
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,520
a badge of honour...
my son taught me.

246
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,000
And they should also ban all these
cyclists from the roads.

247
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,760
All these stupiak bugger.

248
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,920
You know what is stupiak?

249
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,080
Stupid and piak you...
I taught you before.

250
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,360
All these stupiak buggers,

251
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,920
say want to cycle to exercise.

252
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,320
If you want to exercise,
you go to a gym.

253
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,320
Why you exercise on the road?

254
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,920
This is Andre Chichak, The Noose.

255
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:05,640
Growing up in a country of
more than 1.5 billion people,

256
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,520
the concept of personal space

257
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,560
is quite foreign to most of us Chinese.

258
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:15,080
And given the rising number of
disputes here amongst neighbours,

259
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,400
it seems Singaporeans too

260
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,320
are slowly getting used to the idea.

261
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,000
Here’s Bertha Haryani with the story.

262
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,280
When people live close to each other,

263
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,000
it's inevitable that disputes will arise.

264
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,840
Most of the time, neighbours
tolerate minor inconveniences

265
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,440
that overstimulate one's senses
of sight, hearing and smell.

266
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,640
But once they’ve reached
the limit with that,

267
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,840
they get their members of parliament,
or MPs, involved.

268
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,920
Actually, residents, nowadays,
are very savvy.

269
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,280
If they have an issue
with their neighbours

270
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,800
they will find my email address
on the government website,

271
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,320
cc my boss and all my fellow
cabinet colleagues

272
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,480
so I cannot don’t reply.

273
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,240
Yes, dealing with all these issues

274
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,880
takes time away from my
golf and wine tasting,

275
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,240
but it is essential to deal
with all these problems

276
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,160
to preserve a harmonious living
environment for one and all,

277
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,280
and I, personally, take pride
in dealing with each and every…

278
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,640
What?

279
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,800
Neighbour playing mahjong...
baby cannot sleep.

280
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,440
What's the big deal?

281
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,960
Ask my grassroots leader to deal with it.

282
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:35,320
Like I said, I always put
my constituents first.

283
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,880
While most are using official channels
to settle neighbourly disputes,

284
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,080
some Singaporeans find that
such orthodox methods

285
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,480
are taking too long to get things done.

286
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,960
Increasingly, residents such as
68-year-old Mr Kow Peh Seng

287
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,840
are taking matters into their own hands.

288
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,600
This estate is damn old.

289
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,560
The people that live here are
either pioneer generation

290
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,560
or those losers that fall short of
qualifying to be pioneer generation.

291
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,920
And then, recently,

292
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,320
these youngsters moved
into the estate...

293
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,680
Say this place has a lot of “flavour”,

294
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,360
got “unique taste”.

295
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,560
Hello, this is HDB.

296
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,560
You think what? Satay Bee Hoon.

297
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,400
And then the newlyweds

298
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,440
that moved into the flat next door...

299
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,000
Every night like their
wedding night like that.

300
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,480
Every night they try to break record

301
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,240
for the highest pitch
the human voice can reach.

302
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,400
Then the pictures on my wall

303
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,920
every night shaking one, you know.

304
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,400
Then you know what the best part is?

305
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,280
My wife come and ask me,

306
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,360
“Why you not like that?”

307
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,160
Apart from making verbal threats,

308
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,160
Mr Kow has put up posters
all over the block,

309
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,560
detailing his neighbours' poor behavior,

310
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,920
thrown chicken blood at their doorstep,

311
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,000
and rung a shame bell
whenever they leave home.

312
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,120
However, the couple in question
remain unfazed.

313
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,920
No! We’re not offended.

314
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,440
In fact, that is the reason
why we moved in.

315
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,120
Yes! I personally feel it is very real

316
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,280
to be engaging with a
wife-beater-wearing elderly man.

317
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:13,040
Yeah. Our parents offered us a house
closer to them in Bukit Timah,

318
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,680
but we wanted to experience
what is the real Singapore like.

319
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,720
Yeah, I don’t know about you, dear,

320
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,160
but I felt like Mr Kow really
connected with us

321
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,480
when he used that
Game of Thrones reference.

322
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,600
He smeared chicken blood
at our door this morning, you know?

323
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,560
Oh yeah, I took a picture of it.

324
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,640
You see.

325
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,920
Oh, I forgot to post it.
Lucky you reminded me.

326
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,280
Wait ah. I hashtag, artintheheartlands.

327
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,080
Hashtag, chickenblood.

328
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,160
Hashtag yearoftherooster.

329
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,600
So clever.

330
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,640
Looks like Mr Kow will need to invest

331
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,720
in some noise-cancelling headphones

332
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,520
to use for the foreseeable future.

333
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,920
This is Bertha Haryani,
reporting for The Noose.

334
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,900
Time for a quick break,
here on The Noose.

335
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,860
Okay, coffee time.

336
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,700
Welcome back to The Noose.

337
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:23,820
In a bid to improve security in
government computer networks,

338
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:27,340
civil servants have been barred
from using the internet.

339
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:31,100
Andre Chichak visited a government
department recently

340
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,900
to see how civil servants are coping.

341
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:39,340
What has been a simple pleasure
for many government employees,

342
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,780
will soon become forbidden fruit.

343
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,940
The government has just released news

344
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:47,980
that it will restrict internet access
to over 100,000 computers

345
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:51,260
used by public servants by June 2017.

346
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,540
Big news for a small island.

347
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,540
This announcement has,
of course, been met

348
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,660
with a mixed response by the public

349
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,260
and in particular,
government employees.

350
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,940
I spoke to Mr Seow On Seow
of the IDA,

351
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,300
the leading agency for this exercise,

352
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,940
about this major decision.

353
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,100
So, you know, we live in a very

354
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,460
dangerous cyber world, right, Andre?

355
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,580
You know, not me, not you,

356
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,500
but what if, you know,
accidentally, someone,

357
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,460
one day,

358
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,860
go to one of those...

359
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,220
how can I put it delicately…

360
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,820
YYY site.

361
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,500
And then the computer got virus,

362
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,820
and then the virus jump from
this computer to that computer.

363
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,180
Then from there, go to here,

364
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,660
then from here, go to there,

365
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,100
then from there, go to there,

366
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,420
then from there, go to here,

367
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,620
then from here, go to there.

368
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,820
Then how?

369
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:48,260
It’s very dangerous, Andre...
very, very dangerous.

370
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,260
So we have to be extra careful.

371
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,220
Yes, yes, Mr Seow,

372
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,300
so I understand that your agency

373
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,780
has been on the no-internet trial
for a few months now.

374
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,580
So how has it been so far?

375
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,260
Actually, it has been very
excellent, you see,

376
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,860
You know, our productivity
has gone up.

377
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:07,740
But we, at first, have to get used
to this spike in productivity.

378
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,740
We are not very used to it.
We don’t know how to manage it.

379
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,380
Ultimately, it’s all thanks to my

380
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,380
excellent, genius HR skill,

381
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:20,580
that’s why this transition
has been very smooth.

382
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:25,100
While Mr Seow and his colleagues
may be all praises for it,

383
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,900
there are some voices of resentment.

384
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,780
Our next interviewee
declined to be named.

385
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,860
<i>Eh, tak boleh lah.

386
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,100
How can like that?

387
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,340
What do you expect me
to do the whole day?

388
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,060
Work?

389
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,660
Work also need to destress
what. Right, guys?

390
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,980
-Right, Right.
-I agree.

391
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:43,860
You’re right lah, Mr Seow.

392
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,980
Seow? What "Seow"?

393
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,620
Seow (siao) means 'crazy'.

394
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,820
What, "Mr Seow"?

395
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,540
Can you edit that part, please?

396
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,740
Everybody knows that it's nonsense.

397
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:54,340
Got virus, you just add the firewall.

398
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,620
If it’s a strong virus, you just
add a stronger firewall,

399
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,140
like have 2 walls instead of 1.

400
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,980
It’s common sense.
Everybody knows that.

401
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,940
For example, let’s say if you have
a cockroach in your house,

402
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,860
you won’t just move out of your house
or demolish your house, right?

403
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,980
You won’t, what.

404
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,740
You won’t. This one waste of time.

405
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,340
Okay, okay, tissue, tissue...$1.

406
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,300
Buy, lah, $1 only, $1.

407
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,020
Buy, lah. Why you don’t want?

408
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,020
Then you waste my time, for what?

409
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,620
Yeah, yeah...I know.

410
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,580
Wait, you mean...

411
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,100
Like that, my teacher
got no internet, ah?

412
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,060
<i>Baik ke apa...

413
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,780
No internet, means they do work slower,

414
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,940
means they mark the paper slower,

415
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,340
means they give back the paper slower,

416
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,180
less homework means less stress, lah.

417
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,460
Thank you, teacher. Terima kasih!

418
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,220
<i>Selamat Raya.</i>

419
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,500
Hey, this is great...'live' TV. Sayang.

420
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:56,020
Despite this overwhelming divide
amongst Singaporeans,

421
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:59,900
one government agency
has indicated its absolute support.

422
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,540
For many years,
I have sent letters by post.

423
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,700
But of course I’ve never
received any replies,

424
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,860
but today, we have achieved

425
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,420
all that we’ve been working for.

426
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,540
Look at that, man, look at that.

427
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,500
Thanks to this no internet,

428
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,780
we will see an increase of people

429
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:23,540
coming to the parks
and actually enjoying nature.

430
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,020
You know, Singapore
got so much beauty,

431
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,380
why you keep looking
down at the phone.

432
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,380
<i>Dey!</i>

433
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,980
Look up, dey!

434
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,500
Look natural, dey.

435
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,380
Since the break of the news,

436
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,300
we’ve had some really
bad cases sent to us.

437
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,500
These internet addicts

438
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,700
did not take the news well,

439
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:51,900
but thanks to our 12-step internet
addiction programme,

440
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:56,500
we will achieve an
internet-free workplace!

441
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,100
Come sing with me,

442
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,660
<i>No internet, no cry!</i>

443
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,600
While it may take a while
to totally wean off

444
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,080
government employees
from the internet,

445
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,400
it seems that, whether we like it or not,

446
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,560
we will all find our ways of
accepting this, sooner or later...

447
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,920
As usual.

448
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,800
This is Andre Chichak,

449
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,880
The Noose.

450
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,600
And that brings us to the end
of this edition of The Noose.

451
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,080
I’m B.B.See.

452
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,960
Be sure to tune in again
next week for more of The Noose.

453
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,400
And don’t forget to book your tickets

454
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,360
to the second edition of
The Noose & Kakis Stage Show,

455
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,960
happening from May 19th to 21st,

456
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,640
at the MES theatre in Mediacorp.

457
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,560
My name is Xin Hua Hua.

458
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,000
Good night.

459
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,400
You did that last week.

460
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,760
Hey, I never stand here before
at the end of the show.

461
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,040
It's all about me.
