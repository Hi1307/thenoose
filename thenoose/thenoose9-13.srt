1
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,520
The Headlines:

2
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,120
Esmond Wan steps forward
to do a good deed

3
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,480
that backfires spectacularly.

4
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,720
And more businesses in the vice
industry are going digital.

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,600
Hello and welcome to The Noose.

6
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,760
I’m B.B.See…

7
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,600
And I’m Xin Hua Hua.

8
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,160
Hey, ladies,

9
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,280
kissing...

10
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,080
burns 5 calories a minute.

11
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,080
How about a workout?

12
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,080
As the minister-at-large at the
Ministry-Without-Portfolio,

13
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,440
Esmond Wan has the unenviable task

14
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,600
of dealing with problems that
nobody else wants to deal with.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,840
To understand what makes
this great man tick,

16
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,520
The Noose was recently given
unprecedented access

17
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,760
to his home and family.

18
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,320
Here’s Jojo Joget with the story.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,320
Unlike their Western counterparts,

20
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,440
the families of Singaporean politicians

21
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,880
are rarely brought into the limelight
for political campaigning.

22
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,720
In an unprecedented move, however,

23
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,640
Minister-without-portfolio, Esmond Wan,

24
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,960
is giving The Noose an exclusive,

25
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,560
unfiltered look
into his home and family life.

26
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,680
Actually, my staff and I
have been analysing

27
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,240
responses of Singaporeans
to world leaders

28
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,280
and we discovered
that many millennials

29
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,600
like former US president Obama.

30
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,920
After a year of brainstorming,

31
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,720
we discovered that the solution
is to become more relatable.

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,160
And what better way to be
more relatable

33
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,880
than to show that ministers

34
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,680
are people with homes too.

35
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,120
So without much further
ado about nothing,

36
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,120
my name is Esmond Wan

37
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,440
and welcome to my crib.

38
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,080
Please come with me.

39
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,920
This is my living room.

40
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,720
To be more relatable

41
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,800
to most Singaporeans’ living standards,

42
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,240
we downgraded from a
25000-square-foot bungalow

43
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,520
to a 15000-square-foot bungalow.

44
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,720
This is the perfect place for me
to store all my trophies and awards

45
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,240
that I have won since primary 1.

46
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,160
But, like most Singaporeans,

47
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,360
I, myself, have experienced failure.

48
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,320
Just like in primary 4,

49
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,800
when I topped my primary school,

50
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,960
except in moral education.

51
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,240
Please come with me.

52
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,960
This is my sofa.

53
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,840
My family and I like to sit here

54
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,240
and watch "House of Cards"

55
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,080
to experience, with most Singaporeans,

56
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,040
the political intrigue and good acting

57
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,640
that we never get to experience here.

58
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,200
Darling, just in time.

59
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,760
This is my wife, Ching Gek.

60
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,600
Say "hello" to the camera.

61
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,200
Dear, let me finish this first.

62
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,360
As you can see,

63
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,320
as the CEO of Chempedak Holdings,

64
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,320
my wife is very busy.

65
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,480
Check out my Facebook post.

66
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,720
This...post. It's quite funny, right?

67
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,520
This is my casual dining room.

68
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,720
The breakfast nook is around the corner

69
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,760
and the formal dining room

70
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,600
for wine tasting and high tea
is two floors up.

71
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,200
Please come with me.

72
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,600
As you can see,

73
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,440
this is one of the many tributes
I have received

74
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,960
from Singapore’s street artists.

75
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,800
It is a constant reminder for me

76
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,800
to strive to better the lives
of Singaporeans,

77
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,000
because some of them are too poor
to afford Photoshop.

78
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,800
-Daddy,
-Aiyo!

79
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,280
I’ve completed a 50-year prediction

80
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,840
of all the major global and domestic
incidents that will affect your party...

81
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,080
excluding affairs.

82
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,680
Yes.

83
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,880
Top 0.01 percent of her cohort.

84
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,440
She could have attended any
school in the world,

85
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,160
but we made sure she went
to a local university.

86
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,960
Good job, girl...

87
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,080
And this is my master bedroom.

88
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,960
Come in, come in.

89
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,800
Welcome, welcome.

90
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,680
Papa E-dawg in the house, yo!

91
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,720
Yo, yo…

92
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,920
Here we go!

93
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,680
No, no, no, no.

94
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,920
As you can see, we support the Arts.

95
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,320
Cut, cut, cut, cut.

96
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,640
Ah Boy, I tell you not to play
with your money.

97
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,080
<i>Haiya…</i>

98
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,680
The Ministry-Without-Portfolio
is confident

99
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,760
that this “House with Ministers”
strategy will pay off

100
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,880
and intend to let the rest of
Minister Wan’s colleagues

101
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,040
grant the same access to The Noose.

102
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,360
If nothing else, the Ministry promises
that it will be more entertaining

103
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,040
than having the national
broadsheet interview them

104
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,880
in the column “Dinner with Hachiko”.

105
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,760
Reporting for The Noose,

106
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,000
this is Jojo Joget!

107
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,880
Who’s Hachiko, in the first place?

108
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,680
I only know Pikachu.

109
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,800
A recent letter in a local newspaper

110
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,320
made a passionate call
for Singaporeans

111
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,200
to watch more locally-produced
television shows.

112
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,520
As expected, the letter
was ridiculed online

113
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,280
and prompted a debate on
the quality of local shows.

114
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,960
Here’s Jojo Joget with the story.

115
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,760
The humble television

116
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,160
has its place in just about every
home in Singapore,

117
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,400
yet recent studies have shown

118
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,640
that Singaporeans are not
watching enough

119
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,760
of locally-created programmes.

120
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,520
Despite local TV being free-to-air,

121
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,800
Singaporeans would rather
watch overseas content,

122
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,240
as expressed by Mr Chao Keng.

123
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,600
I mean, why watch local shows

124
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,240
when you can watch shows
from over the world?

125
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,560
There’s what...
Korean, American, Thai…

126
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,800
You name it...I can watch it all online.

127
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,080
Anything!

128
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,040
It’s like…why would you
only eat chicken rice

129
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,840
when you can have an
international buffet?

130
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,400
Right? Right...

131
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,160
I recently watched local TV

132
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,480
and it’s just not the same.

133
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,480
It’s like meeting up with an ex.

134
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,440
You are very excited, at first,
to reconnect and meet up,

135
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,880
but then you realise you got
nothing in common.

136
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,400
Then you wonder how the both of you
even fell in love in the first place.

137
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,280
I can’t believe I used to
watch "Crimewatch".

138
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,200
However, there are others,
like Mrs Chap Chye,

139
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,280
who are raising awareness for the
conservation of Singapore television.

140
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,680
Preserving our local television heritage

141
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,480
is of utmost importance!

142
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,760
Singapore broadcasting has been
around since the 1960s.

143
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,480
That’s 50 years’ worth of history
and programming!

144
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,040
Well, most of it is...okay,

145
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,120
but still, it's 50 years’ worth!

146
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,800
Sometimes when my kids
watch TV with me,

147
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,240
they’ll ask me, “Mom, before "Tanglin",

148
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,480
what kind of drama do you watch, ah?”

149
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,360
So I tell them,

150
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,080
“Long before your time,

151
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,480
there was 'Under One Roof'

152
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,800
and 'Phua Chu Kang'.

153
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,640
It was the best in Singapore,
JB and some say Batam.

154
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,600
Come, I show you on Toggle.”

155
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,440
After they watched it on Toggle,

156
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,400
they were very fascinated…

157
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,040
that it was not shot in HD.

158
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,880
So they watch their Korean dramas.

159
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,560
If Singaporeans continue to only
watch overseas content,

160
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,040
then the demand for our local TV

161
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,880
will dry up and disappear forever…

162
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,520
just like 'The 5 Show'.

163
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,520
Or 'Not the 5 Show'.

164
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,000
Despite the decrease in ratings
and audience size,

165
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,680
the future of local television is bright,

166
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,560
according to local
network content creator, Chin.

167
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,320
Look, let’s be real.

168
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,200
Competition is tough, being the only
national broadcaster in Singapore.

169
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,960
Do you know how many
other TV companies

170
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,320
we had to put out of business
so we could survive?

171
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,440
Just kidding…

172
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,960
With regards to the decreasing numbers,

173
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:01,560
we’re going to make sweeping changes
that will revitalise our company!

174
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,760
Firstly, do you know about 360 videos?

175
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,800
Well, we’re going to have...

176
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,520
720 video!

177
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,880
That’s right, 720 video.

178
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,200
That’s 360 times…

179
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,720
two, yeah.

180
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,400
So for 360 content,

181
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,160
you must move your head or device...

182
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,960
around, once, to see the whole image.

183
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,800
But with our new patented 720 content,

184
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,120
you not only make one,

185
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,920
but two spins before you see
the whole image.

186
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,720
So you’ll get twice the
amount of content

187
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,840
as compared to 360 content!

188
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,000
It’ll make for some very interesting
storytelling, that’s for sure!

189
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,960
We’re also working with the
Ministry-Without-Portfolio

190
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,880
to disable internet access across
Singapore during primetime.

191
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,680
That way, we can ensure

192
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,600
that we’re the only viable
entertainment option

193
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,880
and Singaporeans won’t have
a choice but to watch us!

194
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,080
Well, I think I better stock up
on blu-rays and DVDs.

195
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,320
Reporting for The Noose,

196
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,440
this is Jojo Joget.

197
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,280
Okay, we’re off for a break now.

198
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,960
Coming up, a tear-jerking call
for Singaporeans

199
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,360
to watch more local television.

200
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,720
Stay tuned.

201
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,240
Hello and welcome back to The Noose.

202
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,680
If you’re a business owner,

203
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,640
it’s almost unimaginable to not have
an online presence these days.

204
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,120
And as Jacques Ooi reports,

205
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,400
it applies to businesses in the
vice industries as well.

206
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,600
In our ever-changing
economic landscape,

207
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,240
companies are looking
at ways to innovate

208
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,080
and those in the vice industries
are no different.

209
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,280
To help them keep up with the times,

210
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,760
a prominent local ad agency

211
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,640
is working to give businesses
in Singapore’s less-savoury trades

212
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:22,360
a facelift through social media
marketing and rebranding.

213
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,400
As Singapore’s premier
social media marketing firm,

214
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,960
we have made it our duty to help local
businesses meet the demands of today.

215
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,520
Some of these trades have been
around since time immemorial.

216
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,120
So what we need to do
is strike a balance

217
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,240
in preserving heritage
and pushing up click-through rates.

218
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,520
After all, I think it’s important
that we help

219
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,880
homegrown enterprises keep afloat.

220
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,280
One satisfied customer of GOODFLUFF

221
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,760
is 52-year-old Kwek Tai Long.

222
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,680
Mr Kwek originally worked
his way to the top

223
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,280
of a local vice conglomerate,

224
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,040
but left 5 years ago
after a management dispute,

225
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,760
to set up his own
money lending operation.

226
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,760
Originally, I named the
company Money4U

227
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,440
because I want my company to be
friendly and straightforward.

228
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,760
But business was average only.

229
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,600
So my daughters told me
to engage Ah Cat.

230
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,520
Ah Cat came in and analyse

231
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,360
and told me that the name was…

232
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,200
was what, ah?

233
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,840
Too generic.

234
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,480
Not good for business.

235
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,960
Sound like those
<i>Ah Beng, Ah Seng company.

236
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,320
Cannot.

237
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,120
Actually, I quite paiseh,
because Ah Cat told me

238
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,040
my name is damn big in this industry

239
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,800
and I should put it in!

240
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,520
We even have a new tagline:

241
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,800
“How to make a KwekBuck with us!”

242
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,920
You get it, right?

243
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,960
Get it, then I want to play pool…

244
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,320
Apart from an extensive online
marketing campaign,

245
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,040
GOODFLUFF will also be creating
original web content

246
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,000
to reach out to a yet
untapped millennial crowd.

247
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,400
The first step?

248
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,400
An all-access reality show

249
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:15,160
that features Mr Kwek and his two
Instagram-famous daughters,

250
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,280
KinDa and KaiLi.

251
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,800
Everyone thinks that we look like
average Lians, but we’re not.

252
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,120
We are more-than-average Lians.

253
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,360
Both of us graduated summa cum laude
from business school in New York.

254
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,600
So you know we have what it takes
to take vice into the new millennium.

255
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,840
Here’s a sneak peek of the first episode

256
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,840
of this new webseries.

257
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,240
-Daddy
-Yeah..

258
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,000
Daddy…

259
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,920
Don’t anyhow grab my stick.

260
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,600
Jie and I want to talk to you
about expanding our business.

261
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,880
-Yeah, this is my business proposal...
-Our business!

262
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,520
We want to open a club!

263
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,200
Ladies only!

264
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,200
Ladies only?

265
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,400
Then how do I go in?

266
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,640
-You are mummy, what.
-Oh.

267
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,240
The entry requirement is as long
as everyone does this.

268
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,320
Like that, then where they chop?

269
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,560
Chop here?

270
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,400
Must tell your door person to chop here.

271
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,440
-So, okay?
-Okay, can, can...

272
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,720
Wait, wait, wait!

273
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,040
Social media.

274
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,520
Smile lah, Jie.

275
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,960
Everybody one, two...

276
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,480
-Hashtag…KwekBucks.
-Hashtag...RichDaddy.

277
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,760
Not fair, you know!
Life is not fair. It was my pitch!

278
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,760
And then that...stole my pitch, okay!

279
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,200
What is this? What is this?

280
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,520
Anyway, since I’m the youngest,

281
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,040
daddy say must always give in to me.

282
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,960
Everybody, you know what to do.

283
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,600
life is always full of ups and downs,
so you must always stay zen.

284
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,920
And this is how I stay zen.

285
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,640
Everyone,

286
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,160
I love you all.

287
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,600
Sign off, KinDa.

288
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,560
Love you all.

289
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,000
-Daddy!
-What?

290
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,560
Why you change your mind?

291
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,040
Our focus is money lending,
not clubbing.

292
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,680
But you say you will do what I want!

293
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,920
Now, no.

294
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,560
Please, daddy, please…

295
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,440
-Cannot!
-Please…

296
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,640
Please…No!

297
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,200
You everything also don’t let us do.

298
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,320
How you expect us to take
care of the business?

299
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,640
You suck!

300
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,480
Don’t like that.
Smash this, don’t smash my logo!

301
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,000
Daddy, don’t angry. Lai, lai…

302
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,200
'Live', 'live'…Show them.

303
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,400
Zen.

304
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,960
That preview clip alone has generated

305
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:45,360
a 200 percent increase in
business enquiries from millennials

306
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,720
and a 500 percent increase
in applicants

307
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,280
for the position of ‘runner’ at KwekBuck.

308
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,720
GOODFLUFF is confident
that it can achieve

309
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,120
similar success for its other clients

310
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,120
and take vice in Singapore
to a whole new level.

311
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,520
This is Jacques Ooi,

312
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,360
reporting for The Noose.

313
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,600
Savvy politicians won’t miss the chance

314
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,560
when a good photo opportunity
presents itself.

315
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,400
But as Andre Chichak finds out,

316
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,720
sometimes it can go horribly wrong.

317
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,840
Minister Esmond Wan was on
his way to visit a friend

318
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,360
when he saw something that
affected him greatly.

319
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,560
In the carpark next to his friend’s block,

320
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,520
an elderly lady looked like she was
struggling with a pile of junk.

321
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,200
Minister Wan instinctively knew

322
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,000
that he had to give the
poor lady a helping hand.

323
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,040
And immediately post his
good deed on social media.

324
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:40,800
Needless to say, it didn’t take long for
netizens to react strongly to his post.

325
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,400
Can you believe the gall of that woman?

326
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,200
How dare she!

327
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,320
Minister Wan tried to help her...

328
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,000
Such a good man, right?

329
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,440
But instead of letting him
have his moment,

330
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,360
she photobombed him instead.

331
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,520
I’m so upset.

332
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,720
My followers are so upset.

333
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,480
We are going to find her
and photobomb her

334
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,240
and upload to FaceTube.

335
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,240
Others also questioned why the woman

336
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,240
did not prevent the minister from
carrying such a heavy load,

337
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,120
given that he was just discharged
from hospital a couple of weeks ago.

338
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,160
So what if he offers you help
to carry things?

339
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,520
You must not tax the poor man.

340
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,680
Since we all know that he
has been sick recently.

341
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,200
He is one of the very few capable
ministers left in the cabinet.

342
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,960
We cannot afford to let anything
bad happen to him.

343
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,160
The Noose managed to track down
the elderly lady in question

344
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,920
to get her side of the story.

345
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,960
I was just carrying my things

346
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,320
from the void deck to the carpark.

347
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:45,160
It is part of my exercise routine...
every day I’ll do.

348
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,000
Out of nowhere, this crazy man

349
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,160
suddenly come and take
my things away from me.

350
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,120
Then we struggled and I asked him
what he want to take it from me?

351
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,600
He said I shouldn’t be struggling.

352
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,080
I tell him “Sir, I was just trying
to keep fit, you understand?

353
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,920
At my age, I need to do something.”

354
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,480
But he refused to listen.

355
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,640
Then, how come, so nice, just then got
one photographer standing with him.

356
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,880
You tell your minister, want to wayang
also wayang properly, ah!

357
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,040
This is Andre Chichak,

358
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,120
The Noose.

359
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,600
Time for a quick break here
on The Noose.

360
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,160
Welcome back to The Noose.

361
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,840
Several weeks ago, we did a story

362
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,640
on how a once rising star
in Singapore’s athletics scene

363
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,840
faded away due to
his dependence on sugar.

364
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,680
As a result, he made way

365
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,720
for national 100m-record-holder,
UK Shyam,

366
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,160
to be Singapore’s fastest man.

367
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,600
And UK Shyam has now very
generously offered Jamal Hussein

368
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:03,200
an opportunity to put things right
with a one-off race.

369
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,440
I would say it's a dream come true

370
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,400
to get my race against UK Shyam.

371
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,800
Actually, the dream is more for him.

372
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,160
Jamal was once my greatest rival
when we were 7 years old.

373
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,640
He used to be a stud muffin.

374
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,880
But now he is just a muffin.

375
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,640
He holds the national record of 10.37.

376
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,200
I'm sure that if my running career didn't
go off the rails during my teens,

377
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,760
I would have gone under
10 seconds...easily.

378
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,880
That is very natural.

379
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,800
It's like saying the sun rises
from the east,

380
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,760
the fish can swim, the birds can fly.

381
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,800
I’m not even exaggerating. I’m serious...

382
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,160
below 10 seconds.

383
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,240
I think the only thing he can finish
under 10 seconds is 5 curry puffs.

384
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,120
I'm going to put him out of his misery.

385
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,440
Today, I'm going to put things right.

386
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,320
I'm going to show Singapore
what they missed out on.

387
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,280
My advice is when you watch,

388
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,760
try not to blink.

389
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,000
I had it, man, I had it...

390
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,160
but...you notice something?

391
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,560
He was wearing shoes.

392
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,360
Spiked running shoes, some more.

393
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,200
In kampong days, where got shoes?

394
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,640
Can win, but please, be original, ah.

395
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,720
I'm glad we've finally put
the matter to rest.

396
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,200
I wish him all the best in
whatever he does.

397
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,240
But I hope he stops calling me.

398
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,360
Bravo, bravo, bravo!

399
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,160
Thanks to UK Shyam,
for giving us all hope.

400
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,680
And that brings us to the end of
this season of The Noose.

401
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,600
If you want to see more of us,

405
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,160
Farewell, fans, followers and friends.
