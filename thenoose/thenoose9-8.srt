1
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,120
The Headlines:

2
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,040
No smartphones?

3
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,560
No problem as taxi drivers
re-define cool.

4
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,040
Made by a Singaporean?

5
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,000
No thanks,

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,400
as local designers
bear the brunt of globalisation.

7
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,480
Dragons and goats are so last century.

8
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,000
Introducing the hipster zodiac.

9
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,880
Hello and welcome to The Noose.

10
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,400
I am B.B.See…

11
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,800
And I’m Xin Hua Hua.

12
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,160
Hey, ladies,

13
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,800
life without you
is a like broken pencil…

14
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,600
-pointless.
-You are pointless.

15
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,280
Topping the Noose tonight…

16
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,200
yet another variant of taxi service

17
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,880
has entered the saturated
market in Singapore.

18
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,720
A group of local cabbies,

19
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,400
who have been dubbed
“The Un-smart Uncles”,

20
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,920
are now providing a new
niche taxi service

21
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,600
that is increasingly garnering
a cult following

22
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,040
since starting 2 weeks ago.

23
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,520
Here’s Jojo Joget with the story.

24
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,520
Yet another variant of taxi service

25
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,520
has entered the saturated
market in Singapore.

26
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,320
A group of local cabbies,

27
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,960
who have been dubbed
“The Un-smart Uncles”,

28
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,400
are now providing a niche taxi service

29
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,320
that is increasingly
garnering a cult following

30
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,560
since starting 2 weeks ago.

31
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:02,360
The service, which has sparked a larger
anti-smartphone lifestyle movement,

32
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,080
offers customers an immersive vintage

33
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,840
and all-around nostalgic
cab-securing experience.

34
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,840
It was the brainchild of local cabbie,

35
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,480
Nicholas Le Fong, and friends

36
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,520
and some friends
who found themselves

37
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,600
at the shorter end of the stick

38
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,920
as non-smartphone-owning taxi drivers.

39
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,960
Actually,

40
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,920
I’ve considered getting
a smartphone for a long time,

41
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,760
but my wife don’t let me
get the smartphone

42
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,800
because she is scared
I go online and start gambling.

43
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,880
But I tell you, one main reason
that I want to get a smartphone

44
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,320
is because I am always
losing out to all these apps:

45
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,080
Grab, Uber, Graber...don’t know ah.

46
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,320
So many of my friends also
don't have smartphones

47
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,880
because we all have cock-up fingers,

48
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,080
some of us the fingers too fat,

49
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,360
some too skinny,

50
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,000
some the finger always shaking.

51
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,160
We are all old-school chaps

52
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,560
and many of us out there

53
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,320
are losing out because
of this thing, you know.

54
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,480
So one day, I sat down
with my friends, drinking coffee,

55
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,160
we talked about this thing.

56
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,280
We said enough is enough.

57
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,360
We cannot be penalised
just because of our cock-up fingers.

58
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,760
People use all these apps because
they want make a statement,

59
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,720
trying to act cool only,
it’s usually not even cheaper!

60
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,920
So we thought to ourselves,

61
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,960
we must start our own lifestyle brand,

62
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,040
come up with our own pattern!
I show you.

63
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,640
You see?

64
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,040
Nicholas Le Fong and his friends

65
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,640
then started to display their
phone numbers at the back of their cabs

66
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,040
so that customers could personally
call and book them.

67
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,560
This practice grew popular amongst
non-smartphone-using cabbies

68
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,600
and became a big hit with local
hipster millennials

69
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,880
who are relishing the new
“alternative” cab-securing trend.

70
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,000
You see, whenever I make a phone call,

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,880
it is really just to hear this tone.

72
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,400
It’s so good, right?

73
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,640
This waiting process is all part of the
experience, you understand.

74
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,800
I love it.

75
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,760
You see,

76
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,800
my friends and I are really into
this “farm-to-table” cabbie concept,

77
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,720
through all this minimal processing
of phone apps and whatnot.

78
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,240
It is a very down-to-earth and
personal approach

79
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,800
that really brings me back to a time

80
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,560
when life was much more relaxed
and down-to-earth.

81
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,920
The movement has even inspired
many followers of the movement

82
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,720
to give up their smartphones for simpler,

83
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,320
more retro 7/11 prepaid phones.

84
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,360
There are also plans to call out
new service features,

85
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,080
such as taxi booking via pagers
for VIP customers

86
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,240
and reserved spots on pavements

87
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,600
for VVIP customers to hail cabs from.

88
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:00,360
So I really hope I get to
VVVVVVVVVIP status one day.

89
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,240
I mean, I just think it’s a very fulfilling
experience, spiritually, I mean,

90
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,640
to wait at least 10 minutes for a cab
just like in the good old days.

91
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,920
In a way, it is also
a silent protest you know,

92
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,040
against the capitalist modern society,

93
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,680
where they are constantly telling you,

94
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,640
they want more of this,
and more of that,

95
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,720
more of this, more of that.

96
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,280
Quicker, faster!

97
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,680
Honestly, at the end of the day,

98
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,000
it’s all about being grateful,

99
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,040
and embracing “less is more”.

100
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,000
But isn’t that an iPhone 7?

101
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,080
Yes, but I also have
2 vintage 2004 Nokias.

102
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,920
Those who are interested in
becoming a part of the community

103
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,560
should delete all taxi apps
from one’s phone,

104
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,000
and then hit the curb

105
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,880
in search of an elusive, un-smart taxi.

106
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,600
Reporting for The Noose,

107
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,040
this is Jojo Joget.

108
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,000
I have no idea why they’re called
smartphones…

109
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,280
if anything, they seem to be making
people more stupid by the day.

110
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,320
Speaking of "stupid",

111
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,600
it seems Singaporeans aren’t just
capable of appreciating good things

112
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,680
created by their fellow countrymen.

113
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,480
It seems that if you
want to make it in Singapore,

114
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,880
you have to be a success overseas first.

115
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:25,120
Our reporter, Jacques Ooi,
recently met one such fashion designer.

116
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,560
When she was in primary school,

117
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,080
Juraidah Amin’s teachers
never failed to say this

118
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,520
every year in her report book…

119
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,640
She is a dreamer.

120
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,920
I mean, what kind of a remark is

121
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,720
“She’s a day dreamer”?

122
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,000
Did they mean I was an idealist?

123
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Or did they mean to say that
I was day dreaming too much?

124
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,080
Maybe those teachers should have
made their classes more interesting.

125
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,480
Fortunately for Juraidah,

126
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,560
rather than take that
comment as a negative,

127
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,920
her parents encouraged their
only daughter to follow her dreams.

128
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,480
Which she did, pursuing a course
in fashion design

129
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,360
after finishing the 'O' levels.

130
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,680
But for many creative types,

131
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,560
trying to find acceptance
and an audience for their work

132
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,800
proved to be more difficult
than she imagined.

133
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,760
But after 4 years of
dogged perseverance,

134
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,880
she finally hit pay dirt.

135
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,280
A London-based fashion designer
saw a couple of my designs

136
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,080
and offered me a job.

137
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,560
After 2 years of mentoring me,

138
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,600
he helped me with the launch of my
own clothing line called "JUAM".

139
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,000
Because "JUraidah AMin"...so, JUAM.

140
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,040
Everybody thought it was Spanish

141
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,440
and I also kept a low profile,

142
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,120
and just let the clothes
speak for themselves.

143
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,520
The label had a cult following in Europe.

144
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,720
So then, after a while,
I decided to try my luck

145
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,280
back in Singapore
by opening a small boutique.

146
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,720
And rich Singaporeans
fell in love with it,

147
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,400
paying thousands of dollars
for my own dresses.

148
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,920
But with the brand
enjoying wild success,

149
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,800
the press began to ask
questions, such as,

150
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,880
who is behind the success of the label?

151
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,520
When Juraidah finally relented and
did an interview to tell her story,

152
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,840
her sales in Singapore plummeted.

153
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,080
They said, “Why should I pay so much

154
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,080
for something made by a local person?”

155
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,120
My sales plunged by 90 percent.

156
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,440
I even had to close down my boutique

157
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,560
because I couldn’t afford
the rental anymore.

158
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,360
Now, I only have a tiny rack of clothes
in this residential area.

159
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,600
Some say it’s unfair
to paint Singaporeans

160
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,800
as a bunch of snobs
who don’t support local talent,

161
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,680
but it's true, isn’t it?

162
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,240
They point to other home-grown labels

163
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,880
that have enjoyed tremendous success.

164
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,800
So...what gives?

165
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,680
I would attribute this attitude

166
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,520
of all things foreign being good

167
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,960
to globalisation.

168
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,680
You can see this manifest itself
here in Singapore,

169
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,360
in terms of food.

170
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,040
You know, people don’t mind going to
a mid-tier, but crappy restaurant,

171
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:14,080
and paying $15 for a “pasta”

172
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,360
that has nothing else but

173
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,560
tomato puree and minced beef.

174
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,400
But then, look at the hawker who sells
<i>bak chor mee (minced meat noodle);

175
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,240
it has two times the ingredients

176
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,640
and requires five times
the amount of skill.

177
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:38,440
Yet when this hawker wants to
increase prices by 50 cents,

178
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,360
everybody screams murder!

179
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,080
It’s so tragic.

180
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,160
Everyone just KPKB.

181
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,880
And there you have it.

182
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,560
This is Jacques Ooi

183
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,200
reporting for The Noose.

184
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,720
Time for a quick breather.

185
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,200
Coming up…

186
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,720
hipsters unveil a new line-up
of zodiac animals

187
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,000
to bring Chinese New Year

188
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,080
into the 21st century.

189
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,400
Stop it.

190
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,760
Hello and welcome back to The Noose.

191
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,440
We’re just two weeks away
from the Lunar New Year,

192
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,440
but many young Singaporeans are
already groaning about the prospect

193
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,440
of having to wear something red

194
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,280
and going through the motions
of celebrating the festivities.

195
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,400
In a bid to modernise
the Lunar New Year celebrations,

196
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,880
the Board of Cultural Management

197
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,120
has come up with
several recommendations,

198
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,240
including a new roster of zodiac animals.

199
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,960
Here’s Andre Chichak with the story.

200
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,840
<i>Gong xi ah gong xi,</i>
(Congratulations ah congratulations)

201
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,880
<i>fa ya fa da chai</i>
(Let’s prosper with lots of money)

202
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,440
Common lyrics to an often-played
Chinese New Year song

203
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,600
that can be heard all over Singapore

204
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,600
from posh shopping centres

205
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,440
to heartland malls,
and even on the radio.

206
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,080
While the older generation
sees these festive tunes

207
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,800
as an uplifting sign that Chinese
New Year is just around the corner,

208
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,720
many young Singaporeans do not
share their enthusiasm for the holiday.

209
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,920
Well, you know what I’m saying?
Like, you know,

210
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,320
like red totally clashes horrendously
with like my skin-tone,

211
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,720
you know, what I’m saying?

212
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,600
Like, everything about this holiday
is totally like red,

213
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,240
you know what I’m saying?

214
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,240
Like, you know,
like the clothes are like red,

215
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,080
like the decorations are like totally red.

216
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,160
Even like, you know,

217
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,480
the money envelopes...
they are like red,

218
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,120
you know what I’m saying, right?

219
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,200
It totally doesn’t even match

220
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,680
the blue notes you are
supposed to get in it.

221
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,080
Right, you know what I’m saying?

222
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,280
I hate my relatives.

223
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,080
In a bid to appeal to millennials
and prevent traditions from dying out,

224
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,720
the Board of Cultural Management
or BOCUM

225
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,480
has put together a taskforce

226
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,520
of well-known social media
personalities and hipster influencers

227
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,600
to make CNY cool again.

228
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,560
The Creative Taskforce of Influencers
aims to make Chinese New Year

229
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,280
a more relatable festival for
young Singaporeans.

230
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,040
After countless meetings
over artisanal coffee,

231
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,640
we’ve come to the conclusion

232
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,440
that the holiday needs
a major overhaul.

233
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,440
For example, red...out,

234
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,200
Rose Quartz is in.

235
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,720
Lion dance...out,

236
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,840
Internet cat dance is in.

237
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,080
But the pièce de résistance
of the entire plan

238
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,520
is to revamp the 12 zodiac signs,

239
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,760
because, come on, let’s face it,

240
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,920
the basic animals are just so lame.

241
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,280
The 12 new proposed animals
for the zodiac are

242
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,160
Cat,

243
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,040
Owl,

244
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,040
Hedgehog,

245
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,320
Fennec Fox,

246
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,480
Koala Bear,

247
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,520
Panda Bear,

248
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,520
Penguin,

249
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,600
Alpaca,

250
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,720
Guinea Pig,

251
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,920
Slow Loris,

252
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,920
Sloth,

253
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,280
and as a tribute to the Bishan 10,

254
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,320
Otter.

255
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,680
The committee has also included a
‘How to Answer Judgey Relatives’ guide,

256
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,720
which includes responses like,

257
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,920
“I’m not married yet because
I look at your spouse

258
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,520
and fear that bad judgement
runs in the family.”

259
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,760
And “Children? Sure!

260
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,400
I’m not ready, but hey,

261
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,040
what’s life without
decades-long resentment?”

262
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,760
No word just yet on whether BOCUM
will accept their recommendations,

263
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,200
but sources say it is likely to go through

264
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,960
as authorities are afraid

265
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,080
that they will be slammed
on social media

266
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,280
if they criticise the proposal.

267
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,040
This is Andre Chichak,

268
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,120
The Noose.

269
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,040
Millennials in the workforce

270
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,360
have become a concern
for many employers.

271
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,760
Referring to those born after 1985,

272
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,840
the millennial generation grew up
with the internet

273
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,440
and adopted extremely
different values

274
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,640
from the previous generation,

275
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,960
some of whom have compared
them to strawberries,

276
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,880
others, to durians.

277
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,240
But as Bertha Haryani finds out,

278
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,040
help is on the way to assist employers

279
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,440
learn about dealing with millennials.

280
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,800
Millennials in the workforce have become
a concern for many employers.

281
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,720
Referring to those born after 1985,

282
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,400
the millennial generation grew up
with the internet

283
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,640
and adopted extremely different
values from the previous generation,

284
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,160
some of whom have compared
them to strawberries,

285
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,120
and others, durians.

286
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,320
Millennial...

287
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,880
they are like the
<i>Liu Sha Bao, or Salted Egg Crab;

288
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,120
they are very interesting,

289
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,680
but, actually, they are not good for
everyday when you are working.

290
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,160
Too heaty, will get sore throat.

291
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,080
They are all idiots, lah.

292
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,680
Who will pay $8 for a cup of coffee?

293
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,880
In my time, $8...you can rent
a four-room flat, you know!

294
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,400
I think, I think, like, you know,

295
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,400
the older generation,
like my parents, your parents,

296
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,680
our teachers, your teachers,

297
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,280
they don’t try to understand us,

298
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,880
and then they think we are dumb,
but we are not dumb.

299
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,920
We care so much about
social issues, you know,

300
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,040
like the inclusiveness, diversiveness,

301
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,920
feminism, millennialism...
all these things.

302
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,560
And then, a lot of other
social issues, like...

303
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,000
impact of Brexit,

304
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,400
American election,

305
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,000
environment,

306
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,480
plastic...

307
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,200
Oh my gosh, Ben is on!

308
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,920
Ben Kheng is on Snapchat.

309
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,000
We have to do this together.
Can I show him?

310
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,080
There is a clear generational gap.

311
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,600
In order to create a workforce
of one united people,

312
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,880
regardless of race, language

313
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,320
or preferred social media platform,

314
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,600
the Ministry of Manpower
is rolling out new courses

315
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,960
to help employers communicate
with millennials.

316
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,040
As the Chief Millennial Officer,

317
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,840
I have done a lot of research

318
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,480
to help civil servants
convey their message

319
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,680
of helping the young-at-heart

320
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,520
reach out to the actually young at heart.

321
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,960
You see, in the past, right,

322
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,200
we have helped the best generation

323
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,760
convey their ideas in ways which

324
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,400
the new generation can understand,

325
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,240
including the MDA rap,

326
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,720
using Gangnam Style for
every single video

327
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,560
that we have produced since 2012,

328
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,680
and we are now preparing

329
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,920
a Pen-Papaya-Apple-Pen video

330
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,080
to talk about including fruits in the diet.

331
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,360
According to Artisanal Lim,

332
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,920
there has been a gulf between how
employers and the government

333
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,280
have been communicating
with the millennials,

334
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,560
leading to a communication breakdown
and generation gap.

335
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,960
This can be improved by tapping
on all things new,

336
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,480
trendy and faddish,
which all the millennials enjoy.

337
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:15,680
If you think about it, the Five-Step
Mozzie Wipeout is ineffective.

338
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,480
The word "wipe-out",
reminds people of "work-out",

339
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,880
as in the Great Singapore Workout.

340
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,160
And this is considered a rather obiang,

341
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,840
archaic way to communicate, right?

342
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,640
Instead, the NEA should
phrase it in such a way

343
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,600
that millennials can enjoy,
like in a Buzzfeed kind of way.

344
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
For example, they can say,

345
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,640
“Twelve Unexpected Places
Water Can Accumulate

346
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,920
and Cause the Breeding of
Dengue-and Zika-spreading Viruses.

347
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,080
Number 2, 5 and 11
is really true for me!"

348
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,160
You see, that way
millennials will actually click and read!

349
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,480
Finally, millennials no longer
want to sing about

350
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,600
"Where the River Always Flows".

351
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,600
Nor do they want to "Chant Mali Chan".

352
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,640
So going forward, all national day songs

353
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,560
will be written and performed by...
get this…

354
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,000
K-pop stars!

355
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,120
And it will come with
full choreography,

356
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,480
so that millennials can dance it at Scape,

357
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,640
even when it is not National Day.

358
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,560
Actually, we have already adopted

359
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,800
several popular anthems for our ministry.

360
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,920
Like, for the Singapore
Kindness movement,

361
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,440
we have adopted
Super Junior’s "Sorry, Sorry"

362
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,080
and the Ministry of Social and
Family Development

363
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,080
will be encouraging families
to have more babies

364
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,280
using Big Bang’s "Fantastic Baby"...

365
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,400
suitable for all small spaces.

366
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,080
This is Bertha Haryani,

367
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,800
reporting for The Noose.

368
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,280
Let's go home!

369
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,160
If you don’t want to see those,

370
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,920
head to toggle.sg/thenoose

371
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,720
to catch up on any past episodes
you might have missed.

372
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,040
We’ll be right back.

373
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,880
Hello and thanks for staying with us
here on the Noose.

374
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,360
The heavy metal band, Metallica,

375
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,080
is due to perform in Singapore
in a month’s time...

376
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,680
their second gig here in 3 years.

377
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,520
And as Jojo Joget finds out,

378
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,680
besides boisterous
and rebellious young adults,

379
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:39,680
the band also does have some
dedicated followers in high places.

380
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,240
<i>Take my hand</i>

381
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,520
<i>off to never never land!</i>

382
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,040
How can you not like that music?

383
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,480
You are not rock enough.

384
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,360
Call yourself a producer, some more.

385
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,040
Oh, we're ‘on’ already.

386
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,920
One of the most influential

387
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,240
heavy metal bands of all time, Metallica,

388
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,840
is set to return to perform in Singapore
at the Indoor Stadium.

389
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,280
Since the announcement of the concert,

390
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,800
fans around the island

391
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,920
have been professing their love
for Metallica’s music

392
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,440
and the influence it has on their lives.

393
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,440
I’ve been a Metallica fan since 1986!

394
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,680
I have all their albums on vinyl,

395
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,600
way before buying vinyl
was considered cool.

396
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,520
I mean, these youngsters...
they listen to indie these days.

397
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,640
They don’t understand, you know,

398
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,520
they don’t realise
they need music like Metallica

399
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,840
to keep them alive!

400
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,960
They listen to what? Gentle Bones.
We don’t need gentle bones,

401
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,600
we need metal...metal in our blood!

402
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,720
Like my hero, Harry, once said,

403
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,880
whoever governs Singapore
must have that iron in him!

404
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,640
Fans of Metallica and their music
know no boundaries.

405
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,400
But one surprising person
who is a dedicated fan,

406
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,960
is none other than our own
Minister at Large, Esmond Wan.

407
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,680
Actually, I’ve always been
a big fan of the Metallica.

408
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,200
Their music has always
influenced me personally

409
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,320
and shows us how we can run
the government here.

410
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,520
Take for example, their fourth album,

411
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,200
“And Justice for All”.

412
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,760
It is not just an album;

413
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,240
it is also about our judicial system

414
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,560
and how we run our supreme court.

415
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,160
And also, what about “Ride the Lightning”?

416
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,200
That is a personal favourite of my
esteemed colleagues and me.

417
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,960
And it is also a song about riding
the train to work…

418
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,040
if it does not break down.

419
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,600
Then there is also “Master of Puppets”.

420
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,720
That one is a personal favourite

421
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,080
for the party!

422
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,240
Despite the band’s mainstream
success in recent years,

423
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,920
there is a pocket of rock music fans

424
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,960
who are not too excited
by Metallica’s return

425
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,680
to our sunny shores for the third time.

426
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,600
Noisy ah, bro…

427
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,120
I like rock music,

428
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,480
but I like the type of music

429
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,240
where you can, at least,
hear what the singer is singing,

430
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,360
like Bob Marley's “Three Little Birds”.

431
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,800
Their music is so fast and sound like
they are so angry all the time.

432
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,400
That type of music, how to play

433
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,800
when you are trying to romance your
girlfriend at Pasir Ris Park, you tell me?

434
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:29,160
At least the other bands,
like Scorpion and Whitesnake,

435
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,000
you can still, at least, sing along

436
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,440
and they have rock ballads

437
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,760
where you can play different
cover versions at weddings.

438
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,760
Then you can play
the guitar with feeling.

439
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,440
That is what rock music
is all about…feeling,

440
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,880
not like that...fast and furious.

441
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,400
I bet this bugger thinks

442
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,560
Michael Learns to Rock
is also a hard rock band.

443
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,440
Eh, go relax one corner.

444
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,640
Rock never die, okay.

445
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,720
Reporting for The Noose,

446
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,320
this is Jojo Joget.

447
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,360
I think better go buy a ticket.

448
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,280
And that brings us to the end
of this edition of The Noose.

449
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,680
I’m B.B.See.

450
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,480
And I’m Xin Hua Hua,

451
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,680
just a Master of Puppets.

452
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,240
Good night.

453
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,880
I'm a smooth operator.

454
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,080
Haven't you noticed
I haven't been spitting in my cup

455
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,600
for the last couple of hours?
