00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,600
The Headlines:

2
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,880
Tragedy on the fairways as
Minister Esmond Wan

3
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,800
suffers two strokes…over par.

4
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,480
The Football Association
heads to Iceland

5
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,160
to learn about their success
in the game.

6
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,800
And the spat between
neighbours in Jurong

7
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,880
threatens to de-stabilise
the entire estate.

8
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,360
Hello and welcome to The Noose.

9
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,920
I’m B.B.See…

10
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,800
And I’m Xin Hua Hua.

11
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,960
Hey ladies,

12
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,840
can I tie your shoe lace?

13
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,440
Because I can’t have you
falling for anyone else.

14
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,960
Oh, for goodness sake.

15
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,760
Topping the Noose tonight:

16
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,160
Tragedy struck this afternoon

17
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,520
as one of Singapore’s political elite,

18
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,800
Minister Esmond Wan,

19
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,600
was hospitalised following an
incident during a routine

20
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,880
weekly high-level ministerial meeting.

21
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,280
That’s right.

22
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,160
The Noose is continuing
to get updates from the hospital

23
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,880
as the story develops,

24
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,680
but right now we can confirm that
Minister Esmond Wan

25
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,480
suddenly felt dizzy, collapsed

26
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,560
and had to be sent to the hospital.

27
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,000
Here’s Andre Chichak
with more on this story.

28
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,600
Behind me you see one of the most
beautifully-manicured golf courses

29
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,600
of the Parameswara Country Club.

30
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,280
And right here,

31
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,600
on the 15th hole of the course,
is where the Minister suffered not one,

32
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,840
but two strokes, over par.

33
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,120
Esmond is a scratch golfer...

34
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,360
Very consistent player.

35
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,840
I mean, of course,
we’re here almost every day.

36
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,280
For a Par 3 hole like this,

37
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,960
he can get a birdie,
or at least, a par score.

38
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,800
But alamak,

39
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,280
he kena the bunker,
you know.

40
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,120
It was very painful to watch.

41
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,720
When he finished, it was...

42
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,080
altogether 5 strokes.

43
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,120
It’s really teruk (terrible), you know.

44
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,360
I almost got stroke watching it.

45
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,520
Others who saw the minister reported
that when he completed the hole,

46
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,680
he looked visibly uncomfortable.

47
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,320
Unable to deal with the massive
disappointment,

48
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,200
he fainted and collapsed,

49
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,080
causing a ministerial-sized mark
on the green,

50
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,880
which his caddy had to repair.

51
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,400
We spoke to the minister’s
personal physician at the hospital.

52
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,120
Well, it is a good thing that the Minister
received treatment in time.

53
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,160
You see, the anxiety caused
by his poor golf score

54
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,920
actually caused heart palpitations,

55
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,200
hyperventilation and increased sweating,

56
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,640
which, of course,
leads to excess body odour,

57
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,080
which is actually
the cause to his fainting.

58
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,760
The thing is, you know how it is
with these ministers.

59
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,120
They expect everything to fall into place,
so when things don’t, they fall.

60
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,320
What do you mean
I can only choose chicken or fish?

61
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,560
Didn’t my office send you the memo?

62
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,440
Where is my fillet mignon
and kopi luwak?

63
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,560
Hello.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,640
Thank you very much for visiting me.

65
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,520
I want to thank all the Singaporeans
at home for their concern.

66
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,640
Actually, the doctor gave me
one week MC

67
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,360
and said that I can stay here
for one night.

68
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,440
But I think I don’t want to.

69
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,320
The single-bed suite they gave me

70
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,480
is very small and claustrophobic.

71
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,320
Like a jail cell.

72
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,240
Huh!

73
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,520
What do you mean
no more fillet mignon?

74
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,000
Minister Esmond Wan
has since left the hospital

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,160
and is now recuperating at home,

76
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,640
taking this time to analyse
what went wrong with his swing.

77
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,840
In the meantime,
Sub-Prime Minister Hantam Bola

78
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,720
will be taking on the Minister’s
empty portfolio.

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,240
This is Andre Chichak, The Noose.

80
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,480
We wish Minister Esmond Wan
a speedy recovery.

81
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,440
Now let’s cross over to Jurong

82
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,080
where Jojo Joget is investigating
a neighbourhood spat

83
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,080
that is threatening to de-stabilise
an entire community.

84
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,680
Family disputes are a dime a dozen.

85
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,680
But when an innocent third party

86
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,040
gets dragged into the middle of it all,

87
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,320
you know that the pistol head
has hit the fan.

88
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,800
2 weeks ago, one Jurong resident

89
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,240
found herself in such a predicament

90
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,400
when her collection of prized
hip-hop caps were confiscated.

91
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,080
I live on the 2nd floor

92
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,120
and my friends, Lor Mui and Tai Mei..

93
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,400
they are cousins by the way...

94
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,280
they live on the 10th and 7th floor.
You feel me?

95
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,240
So last time, they used to stay
on the same floor,

96
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,720
but then they fought a lot, so now

97
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,040
Tai Mei has got her own space
on the 7th floor. You feel me?

98
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,520
Oh yeah, but then Lor Mui’s clan,

99
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,560
they have a very strict policy
on One Floor policy.

100
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,360
So you know, Tai Mei and I

101
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,720
sometimes we take part in
dance competitions together, right?

102
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,040
And then one day, she wanted
to return them snapbacks

103
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,480
that she borrowed from me.

104
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,640
So on her way down to my house,

105
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,640
she bumped into Lor Mui’s
dim sum-eating clan,

106
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,960
who took away and confiscated
them snapbacks away from her!

107
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,160
How messed up is that?

108
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,320
My family is very influential in this block.

109
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,280
If you want a sheltered
walkway to bus stop?

110
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,120
I get it done...

111
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,480
by the MP.

112
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,200
If you want a void-deck family event,

113
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,440
I make sure you have a good turnout.

114
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,680
All we ask for, is that you,
when the time comes,

115
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,120
stand by my family and our policies.

116
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,000
we have always opposed people
who have ties

117
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,200
with that black sheep, Tai Mei,

118
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,880
including the dance collaborations.

119
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,160
And I have also told Shaquanda
a long time ago,

120
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,920
to follow the One-Floor policy.

121
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,480
She said, "Yes, okay,"

122
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,680
but she continued to conduct
joint-dance exercises. How can?

123
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,000
Welcome!

124
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I’m so happy that Shaquanda
still wants to dance with me,

125
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,480
even though my cousin is bullying her.

126
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,640
That meanie keeps threatening
my friends to stay away from me

127
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,720
as long as I don’t move back.

128
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,680
I just want friends and
my independence.

129
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,040
Is that too much to ask?

130
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,840
Talks have already begun
to recover the caps,

131
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,000
but the proceedings could take months.

132
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,200
Some sources say
this is Lor Mui’s way

133
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,800
of asserting her dominance
over the block.

134
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,520
In the meantime, Shaquanda’s
keeping her fingers crossed

135
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,680
that the caps will be returned in time

136
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,560
for a televised dance show
on August 9th.

137
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,040
These caps are important, yo.

138
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,480
How else will they know that
I’m the real deal?

139
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,640
Reporting for The Noose,
this is Jojo Joget.

140
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,880
Why does that story sound so similiar

141
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,440
to something else I read about recently?

142
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,440
While he mulls over that,
let’s go for a quick break.

143
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,800
Coming up, the state of football in
Singapore could get a shot in the arm,

144
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,520
thanks to Iceland.

145
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,960
Stay tuned.

146
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,720
Hello and welcome back to The Noose.

147
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,040
Have you ever heard of that game,
"Win, Lose or Draw"?

148
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,680
Well, when it comes to
Singapore’s national football team,

149
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,320
they only seem to know
lose or draw, unfortunately.

150
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,680
In a bid to reverse
the fortunes of the Lions,

151
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,920
the Football Association is embarking
on several initiatives,

152
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,160
including going to places like Iceland

153
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,440
to learn from their experiences.

154
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,200
Here’s Bertha Haryani with the story.

155
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,720
What’s the difference between the state
of football in Singapore right now

156
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,520
and a bucket of poop?

157
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,560
The bucket, apparently.

158
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,680
Dumped out in the early stages of a
prestigious regional tournament recently,

159
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,280
the so-called Lions
are licking their wounds

160
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:40,280
in what has been a disastrous year
for the national team.

161
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,520
And in the international rankings,

162
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,320
Singapore lies 171st, in position.

163
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,560
And to put things in perspective,

164
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,480
Singapore's Press Freedom Index

165
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,520
lies higher at 154,

166
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,120
which is saying a lot about
the state of soccer in Singapore.

167
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,560
However officials from the
Football Association

168
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,560
don’t seem too bothered
by these numbers.

169
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,560
Well, you see,

170
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,960
everyone is going on and on
about our current low ranking...

171
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,520
171. But so what?

172
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,800
Do you realize that there are
far more countries in the world today

173
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,640
than there were 20 to 30 years ago?

174
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,320
I will give you an example.

175
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,680
The Soviet Union used to be
one big country

176
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,440
and not the 45 countries
that it split up into.

177
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,520
And also back then,

178
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,280
there were far fewer
independent African countries, right?

179
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,200
So 171...what’s the big deal?

180
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,080
However, I understand the
public’s frustration

181
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,120
with the current state of football today.

182
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,640
So let me just re-assure my
fellow Singaporeans

183
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,920
that we are taking measures to address

184
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,160
the recent spate of bad results.

185
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,800
Okay, so everybody just, chillax.

186
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,360
This year, at the
European championships,

187
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,720
while mighty England crashed out
at the group stage,

188
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,040
minnows Iceland made it all the way

189
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,600
to the quarter-finals of the competition.

190
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,960
And this despite the country not having
a professional domestic league.

191
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,080
The Noose understands that
the Football Association

192
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,440
recently sent a team of
officials to Iceland

193
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,160
to learn how a country

194
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,680
with a population of just over 300,000

195
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,600
is punching far above its weight
in the football world.

196
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,440
It was a very good trip.
We learnt a lot.

197
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,240
Like, if you want
to go to the country,

198
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,840
I think the best time to visit
is definitely not in December,

199
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,720
because the temperature
is minus ten degrees.

200
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,960
<i>Alamak, it was so cold,

201
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,520
lucky my two toes
are still inside my boots.

202
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,200
But at least I get to see this...
what...in the sky,

203
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,720
there is this very colorful,
colorful...like rainbow,

204
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,160
but the rainbow is moving.

205
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,720
Ah, northern lights.
They say it’s called northern lights!

206
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,320
I think Singapore must adopt this

207
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,840
and use this for the Singapore NDP.

208
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,400
At least, with the moving rainbow,
very cantik, very nice.

209
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,520
Okay, but what did you learn
about how football

210
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,520
is being developed
or improved in Iceland?

211
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,240
What can we learn from them?

212
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,280
Oh, the football…ah…

213
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,840
not much, ah.

214
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,920
Because the country there is very cold,

215
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,080
then the players,
they have to keep running,

216
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,080
so that they will keep warm.

217
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,720
But down here, Singapore,
it’s already so hot,

218
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,240
if you run some more,
I tell you, you mampus!

219
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,760
So, unless we can change the
temperature of Singapore,

220
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,720
I think there is no point
in trying to be like Iceland.

221
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,920
Okay, thank you for...

222
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,520
for what, I don’t know, but thank you.

223
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,400
Perhaps, Singapore football
could improve

224
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,280
if we only focus on the management
rather than the players.

225
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,560
This is Bertha Haryani
reporting for The Noose.

226
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,560
Oh, there's ice-kacang just behind here.

227
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,160
For 20 cents more,
they put extra corn on top.

228
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,040
The Singapore Fruit Festival

229
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,320
has gotten itself into a jam
with the authorities.

230
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:16,280
It wasn’t for selling fruits that
were spoiled or out of season,

231
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:21,200
but rather, their produce was
showing off too much skin.

232
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,880
Here’s Andre Chichak with the details.

233
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,680
Fruits and their skin may be good
for your fiber intake,

234
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,240
but having them on display
may land you a hefty fine.

235
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,640
And that is exactly what happened

236
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,680
to the organisers of
the Singapore Fruit Festival

237
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,760
when they received complaints that
their fruits are revealing too much.

238
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,000
Honestly, it was downright seedy

239
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,560
having all those fruits
showing off their skins!

240
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,040
This is nudity you know!

241
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,880
The Singapore Fruit Festival
should not be a skin fest.

242
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,080
It should be banned.

243
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,240
What day and age do we live in now?

244
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,720
Do we still need to see fruits
with their skin on?

245
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,000
Of course not, right!

246
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,480
Nowadays everyone eats
cut fruits without skin

247
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,640
and if you don’t, then shame on you.

248
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,520
We don’t need to see fruits like those
papaya hanging outside in public.

249
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,680
Those sort of stuff

250
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,600
should be kept in the privacy
of your own home kitchen,

251
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,080
but not in the public!

252
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,520
Stupid melon farmers!

253
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,400
Despite the complaints,

254
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,360
fruit sellers from the Singapore Fruit
Festival, like Mr. Chou Kai Lan,

255
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,120
have expressed concerns

256
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,640
that fruit skin is not only
necessary for a healthy diet,

257
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,720
but is also needed for the
safety of the fruit.

258
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,720
Nowadays, Singapore is
very confusing, you know.

259
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,240
Last time, when I was a landscaper,
people say I cannot touch the flower...

260
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,280
cannot touch the pussy willows.

261
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,760
Then how?

262
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,400
Then nowadays, I become a fruit seller,

263
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:47,040
then they say it is inappropriate
to show the fruits with the skin on it.

264
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,400
It doesn’t make sense.

265
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,880
You think about it. The skin forms
a natural protection for the fruit, right?

266
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,680
If you drop the fruit, you still can sell

267
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,960
because you cannot see any difference.

268
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,800
Will you buy a fruit without
the skin on it?

269
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,360
Can you imagine the fruit,
without the skin,

270
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,000
gets touched by all these
insects and cockroaches.

271
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,480
Will you buy it?

272
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
No, right?

273
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,720
Common sense, right?

274
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,960
Despite the practical reasons
for fruit skin,

275
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,800
the Ministry without Portfolio
has taken action

276
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,520
and implemented new measures.

277
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,720
Actually, the recent event at the
Singapore Fruit Festival

278
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,880
was an unfortunate event.

279
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,000
Here at the ministry, we have reflected

280
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,240
and have come up with some new
solution to prevent further incidents.

281
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,080
Moving forward,

282
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,840
we will be banning the sale of food
with the skin on it.

283
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,320
This does not apply to just
fruits and vegetables,

284
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,480
but also seafood,

285
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,280
for example, crabs.

286
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,000
From now on,

287
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,080
only softshell crabs will be approved
for sale at wet markets,

288
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,800
because that crab...

289
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,240
got no shell.

290
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,560
This new ruling will also apply to
food & beverage establishments,

291
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,480
especially the chicken rice sellers.

292
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,600
Chicken rice sellers, from now on,

293
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,440
will only be able to sell chickens
with no skin on it.

294
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,680
The unhealthiest part of
the chicken is the skin,

295
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,520
so the benefits of not eating it

296
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,360
and seeing it

297
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,560
will be of great benefit.

298
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,880
It will help people with their cholesterol!

299
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,640
But I like chicken skin!

300
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,760
It seems like Singaporeans who love
to complain could use a thicker skin.

301
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,640
This is Andre Chichak, The Noose.

302
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,520
I quit.

303
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,280
Time for a quick break,
here on The Noose.

304
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,640
Coming up,

305
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,920
you’ve heard of Economical Rice.

306
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,880
But now, get ready for Capitalist Rice.

307
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,360
Stay tuned…

308
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,680
Welcome back to The Noose.

309
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,520
It's time for a quick report
from our Japanese correspondent,

310
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,800
Nabuyuki Harry Katashi.

311
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,600
<i>Ah, Minna-san Konbanwa!</i>

312
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,040
<i>Watashi wa Nabuyuki Katashi.</i>

313
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,400
This man, Joe Teo-san

314
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,560
wrote a very passionate letter

315
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,280
against young people getting tattoos.

316
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,200
And I agree!

317
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,920
In Japan, we ban people with tattoos

318
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,560
from a lot of places

319
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,800
because tattoos equals yakuza,

320
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,600
yakuza equals criminal,

321
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,800
criminal equals bad!

322
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,880
We must act now

323
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,120
or else Singapore

324
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,280
will become a lawless gangland,

325
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,000
filled with triads, outcasts,

326
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,880
and shady characters,

327
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,680
like in my manga!

328
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,760
I propose that

329
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,520
Japanese brands in Singapore

330
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,200
come to your rescue!

331
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,960
So to all Singaporeans,

332
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,680
If you have tattoos,

333
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,840
no sushi for you!

334
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,760
If you have tattoos,

335
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,480
no Uniqlo for you!

336
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,080
Without all these Japanese
products in their life,

337
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,760
it is only a matter of time

338
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,160
before they return to the path

339
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,920
of the straight and narrow.

340
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:46,160
<i>Watashi wa Nabuyuki Katashi,</i>
reporting from Tokyo, Japan.

341
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,840
Let’s go Nuclear!

342
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,640
Singapore’s hawker food

343
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,320
has always been touted
as cheap and good.

344
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,520
But in recent years,

345
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,560
good hawker food
has been harder to find.

346
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,000
And one main reason for that

347
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,600
is that Singaporeans

348
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,960
just aren’t willing to pay more for food,

349
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,560
despite costs constantly
going up for hawkers.

350
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,400
Here’s Jacques Ooi with the story.

351
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,320
Cheap and good.

352
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,680
Singapore’s unique hawker centres
are loved by everyone,

353
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,880
including tourists, locals

354
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,280
and tissue-paper sellers

355
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,400
for their wide variety of
racially-harmonious dishes,

356
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,280
the strong social and communal
aspect of dining with others,

357
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,720
including complete strangers,

358
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,640
as well as being the only thing
they can afford until payday.

359
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,600
But recently, hawkers have come
under criticism

360
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,640
for several reasons
including raising prices

361
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,360
as well as pretensions to higher food.

362
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,960
Nowadays, all these young people

363
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,800
like to eat high-class food,

364
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,000
like Spaghetti Bolognese.

365
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,400
And all the new citizens come here
and open new hawker stalls,

366
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,120
selling the foreign food from
their home country.

367
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,520
I want to eat my authentic
Singapore cuisine,

368
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,080
like the Caucasian eating the
Hainanese western food,

369
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,040
the Penang assam laksa,

370
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,680
and the Klang bak kut teh!

371
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,680
When I first came to Singapore,

372
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,520
wonton noodles cost me only fifty cents,

373
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,160
and the portions were so big
it was really like one tonne.

374
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,080
Nowadays, tissue paper is $1.00!

375
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,880
These days you buy wonton noodle,

376
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,560
the bowl so big like
the high class restaurant,

377
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,200
but then the portions so small.

378
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,920
You think what? Fine dining?

379
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,720
And every year the prices are also raising.

380
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,360
The other day, I saw in the news,

381
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,520
one fellow, he bought the Economy Rice,

382
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,320
one plate, $18 you know!

383
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,240
If I wanted to pay ridiculous
restaurant prices

384
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,440
for food court food,

385
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,440
I would go to Newton Food Centre

386
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,280
or go to Sentosa!

387
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,000
Hawkers interviewed

388
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,080
say that they are facing
increasing cost pressures

389
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,640
due to the rising cost of
basic food items and utilities.

390
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:14,120
Even if rent is controlled in many
hawker centres here in Singapore,

391
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,320
it is not enough to offset the cost of
operating a business.

392
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:23,200
Also, many young Singaporeans
do not want to be a hawker...

393
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,040
Oh I’m sorry, I mean hawkerpreneur.

394
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,280
So we interviewed one

395
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,480
in the name of
fair and unbiased reporting.

396
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,000
Bro, please bro.

397
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,760
You know nowadays,
got a lot of young boys and girls

398
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,760
want to become YouTube,
Instagram celebrities,

399
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,720
whole day just take photos, take selfies,

400
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,280
post video and collect likes only.

401
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,880
But who want to come here

402
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,040
and actually sweat it out
and earn a living?

403
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,160
Everybody just want to look
handsome, act pretty

404
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,120
and get all these free staycation
and free sponsorship,

405
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,200
free hotel stays from companies
just by posting photos!

406
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,760
Actually Singaporeans
are all very stingy.

407
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,560
For $3.00, they expect
two bowls of mee pok

408
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,120
and one kilo of fishball.

409
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,360
I even had this auntie
come over the other day,

410
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,320
she told me, “Boy,

411
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,720
I could cook for cheaper at home.”

412
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,120
"Cook for cheaper at home"?

413
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,240
Then go home and cook, correct?

414
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,840
This is the Singaporean attitude.

415
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,240
They expect hawker food
to be very cheap.

416
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,040
It is not cheap...they must
understand the cost of labour,

417
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,720
the cost of overheads.

418
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,080
But they are willing to pay more
for Japanese egg tarts

419
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,240
or all these high class coffee.

420
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,000
Correct or not? Nonsense.

421
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,760
So next time, if I take a selfie
of myself in the shop,

422
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,040
then the rent is free?

423
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,320
Seeing things from
a different perspective,

424
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,160
we have Thomas Friedmee,

425
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,200
who sees Singaporean’s changing
spending habits

426
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,880
as an economic opportunity,

427
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:48,160
or rather, an economic rice opportunity.

428
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,280
We feel that Singaporeans now

429
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,720
are willing to pay for value,

430
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,320
and we see value in home-made cuisine.

431
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,840
Therefore we are evolving

432
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,440
a traditional Singaporean favourite,

433
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,560
Economic Rice.

434
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,640
So it will be a new version

435
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,320
for a new millennium.

436
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,720
And we will call it "Capitalist Rice".

437
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,640
And all our ingredients is organic,

438
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,640
locally-sourced, where possible,
and fair-trade,

439
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,760
and we are making a massive profit

440
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,320
using taxpayer’s rebates.

441
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,640
Some of our dishes

442
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,000
include our all-time favourite,

443
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,080
<i>fillet poulet avec pomme de terre</i>

444
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,520
<i>dans sous vichyssoise de Safran</i>

445
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,960
<i>des Indes et poudre de curry,</i>

446
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,720
which is this dish right here,

447
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,480
curry chicken with potato.

448
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,960
And also our newest invention,

449
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,320
I believe it will be very popular,

450
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,560
wait for it…

451
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,520
salted egg in salted egg sauce.

452
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,480
This is Jacques Ooi
reporting for The Noose.

453
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,120
Well that brings us to the end
of this edition of The Noose.

454
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,080
<i>Gong Si Gong Si Gong Si Ni.</i>

455
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,560
It's Gong Xi Gong Xi Gong Xi Ni.

456
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,520
That’s what I said.

457
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,640
No, you said "Gong Si Gong Si."

458
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,240
Anyway, I’m B.B.See.

459
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,680
And I’m Xin Hua Hua.

460
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,560
Be sure to tune in again next week

461
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,280
for more of The Noose.

462
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,320
Hey ladies,

463
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,920
you may fall from the sky,

464
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,480
you may fall from a tree,

465
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,880
but the best way to fall...

466
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,800
is in love with me.

467
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,320
Good night!

468
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,480
You’re disgusting.

469
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,640
#bestclosinglineever.

470
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,040
Whatever.
